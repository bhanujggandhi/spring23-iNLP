<s> the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. <e>	130.75434566819524

<s> but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art. <e>	15.29144685187309

<s> aye that is because you have the right disposition. <e>	14.460619159802368
<s> his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards <title> darcy with a very expressive smile. <e>	38.70263030992013
<s> lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me jane is beauty. <e>	33.864367287994966

<s> i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball. <e>	26.455768303714642

<s> they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine. <e>	28.28622455865227
<s> my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents. <e>	107.66210866941704
<s> the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting. <e>	153.67277936040355
<s> and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment. <e>	21.418630699922822
<s> you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that <title> bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. <e>	20.39040876376946
<s> i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. <e>	50.262946510661
<s> you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged. <e>	28.15478082099822
<s> to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you. <e>	39.938630545704996

<s> by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of. <e>	74.11233643808288
<s> i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference. <e>	28.26316661862874
<s> miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense. <e>	33.12712344307286
<s> the supposition did not pain her. <e>	10.856498447120462

<s> i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. <e>	44.74222084057618
<s> it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day. <e>	40.645670583458106
<s> she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him <e>	30.634827130639938
<s> miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing <title> darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives. <e>	32.42681649064499
<s> you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other is confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire. <e>	120.93399110060183
<s> i never heard any thing so abominable. <e>	6.660654228881807

<s> certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of them. <e>	14.165930793069952
