<s> the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen. <e>	43.00905609677291

<s> i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. <e>	24.181279583093982
<s> <title> hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when <title> hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. <e>	75.19840756164363

<s> i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane one does not often see any body better looking. <e>	23.087972403400848

<s> then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex. <e>	150.18573369504952
