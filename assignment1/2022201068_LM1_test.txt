<s> pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe. <e>	146.76873956904544
<s> by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary. <e>	86.59277561863858

<s> at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner. <e>	108.08253236689343
<s> <title> hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker. <e>	80.40024027617271

<s> <title> hurst looked at her with astonishment. <e>	9.936502521475733
<s> in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well. <e>	32.65357243994844
<s> and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into. <e>	89.27408207919875
<s> i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books. what a delightful library you have at pemberley <title> <e>	77.19826339501044
<s> i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these. <e>	64.1820470323938
<s> elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between <title> bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game. <e>	84.3351800494862
<s> she is now about miss elizabeth bennet is height or rather taller. <e>	67.31282933330576

<s> i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished. <e>	44.653887758321524

<s> yes i do comprehend a great deal in it. <e>	19.107615484194575
<s> certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. <e>	185.52727567748352
<s> all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading. <e>	71.32466809401379
<s> i rather wonder now at your knowing any. <e>	57.90979715557345
<s> are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this <e>	44.187804417405374
<s> i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united. <e>	54.54016871184513
<s> <title> hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when <title> hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. <e>	157.12516268003563
<s> as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room. <e>	77.68557392785017
<s> miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject. <e>	29.458561292937066
<s> this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother is proposal and it was settled that <title> jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better. <e>	33.28541700504613
<s> they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister. <e>	153.76561774459373
<s> elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister is room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from <title> bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. <e>	57.368030410145074
<s> she would not listen therefore to her daughter is proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable. <e>	124.24102582407012
<s> indeed i have sir was her answer. <e>	27.801694042445195
<s> <title> jones says we must not think of moving her. <e>	53.166104247578886
<s> whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes. <e>	133.98402767686318
<s> you begin to comprehend me do you <e>	38.28099965921565
<s> yes indeed cried <title> bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. <e>	53.925758334263215
<s> they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either. <e>	74.27897166021565

<s> i know we dine with four and twenty families. <e>	50.46015580263213
<s> so genteel and so easy he has always something to say to every body. that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter. <e>	167.363753546214
<s> she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley. <e>	36.7801447783317

<s> of a fine stout healthy love it may. <e>	82.06066509675844
<s> but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away. <e>	84.09714852682862
<s> lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. <e>	167.4927904661135
<s> and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also. <e>	49.30504703551913
<s> <title> bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and <title> darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingley is witticisms on fine eyes. <e>	51.714645448700544

<s> it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast. <e>	117.97044904187347
<s> the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting. <e>	205.88931132309304
<s> your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month. <e>	182.190552910032
<s> you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself. <e>	48.387315706717175
