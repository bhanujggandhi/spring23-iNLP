<s> it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. <e>	2.0607159322138346
<s> she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas. <e>	2.23472837330368

<s> of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. <e>	2.2143902001456968

<s> the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with <title> wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball. <e>	1.8737919146401094

<s> i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her. <e>	2.0288775933938283

<s> i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly. <e>	1.9294912350192193
<s> i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either. <e>	1.9965855602870242
<s> i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied. <e>	2.0369355037260926
<s> she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcy is breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another. <e>	1.8505161196741768
<s> they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late <title> darcy is steward. <e>	1.983888223266192
<s> let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to <title> darcy is using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated <title> darcy in a most infamous manner. <e>	2.00188169111295
<s> i do not know the particulars but i know very well that <title> darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. <e>	2.2663616737748757
<s> his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it. <e>	2.097981750899504
<s> i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourite is guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better. <e>	1.761299501299632
<s> his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of <title> darcy is steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself. <e>	2.2136293582981628
<s> i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer. <e>	1.9587950697413996
<s> excuse my interference. it was kindly meant. <e>	2.0398788502863985

<s> jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane is being in the fairest way for happiness. <e>	1.9947159792803337
<s> i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister is what you have learnt about <title> wickham. <e>	2.11018552091549

<s> no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you. <e>	2.360679467177003
<s> <title> bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended <title> darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that <title> wickham has deserved much less attention from <title> darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister is <title> wickham is by no means a respectable young man. <e>	2.2599138782938657

<s> i have not a doubt of <title> bingley is sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. <e>	2.1190953518589106
<s> <title> bingley is defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before. <e>	2.041231232662757
<s> elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingley is regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. <e>	1.8852457003274765

<s> elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that <title> darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to <title> darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance. <title> <e>	2.040651568084865

<s> this is my advice. <e>	2.203389085236285

<s> thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women. <e>	1.918950603945421
<s> but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years. <e>	1.924328391548867

<s> upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration. <e>	1.7297583564986074

<s> indeed <title> collins all praise of me will be unnecessary. <e>	1.9736281070950326
<s> you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say. <e>	1.9287543720987952

<s> and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not <title> collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character. <e>	1.9267920742404452
<s> really <title> collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly. <e>	1.9383168940498525

<s> you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. <e>	1.7871595705198133
<s> your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. <e>	1.8764306105554673
<s> as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females. <e>	1.8639362023562052
<s> i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. <e>	1.9519611547646498
<s> i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible. <e>	1.9290475363067052

<s> to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female. <e>	1.7407816375854175
<s> <title> collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character. <e>	1.7786469002095722
<s> this information however startled <title> bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so. <e>	2.157089971483764

<s> if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity. <e>	1.8173408514209306

<s> without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. <e>	2.1769849524445335

<s> while sir william was with them <title> collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road. <e>	1.8798907289943592

<s> elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by <title> collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty. <e>	1.7613347476497534

<s> it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. <e>	1.8217736678887362

<s> you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice. <e>	1.7023664997269425
<s> two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge. <e>	2.033078355500625
<s> wickham. wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison. but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your is i can only say that i am sorry. the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd. i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country. but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. i had often seen him in love before. at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas is accidental information that bingley is attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. <e>	1.9022667786834042
<s> he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided. <e>	2.1822703165531054
<s> from that moment i observed my friend is behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him. <e>	2.0562294075637544
<s> your sister i also watched. her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening is scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error. <e>	1.9564689355728389
<s> your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable. <e>	2.017079969624596
<s> but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister is countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched. that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason. my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me. these causes must be stated though briefly. the situation of your mother is family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father. pardon me. it pains me to offend you. <e>	1.7702308856186604
<s> he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard. but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. <e>	1.8102136050482036
<s> to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment. i cannot blame myself for having done thus much. <e>	1.8294732914981178
<s> there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister is being in town. <e>	2.13091751206824
<s> i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me. it is done however and it was done for the best. on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer. <e>	2.060406806115327
<s> of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. <e>	2.152393836606134
<s> my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman is education. <e>	2.026223695320268
<s> my father was not only fond of this young man is society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it. <e>	1.8558749087456674
<s> as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner. <e>	2.278147219474406
<s> the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which <title> darcy could not have. <e>	2.0230077671583064
<s> but whatever may be the sentiments which <title> wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character. <e>	1.8555048696293182
<s> it adds even another motive. <e>	2.055897366882939
<s> my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to <title> wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant. <e>	2.0643195734053266
<s> there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. <e>	1.9560420375083845
<s> his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events <title> wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited. <e>	1.88421186076433
<s> he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. <e>	2.0659219417961694
<s> i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. <e>	1.97879511095352
<s> the business was therefore soon settled. <e>	2.2078163924435716
<s> he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds. <e>	1.9900875948679972
<s> all connection between us seemed now dissolved. <e>	1.9696759615290755
<s> i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town. <e>	2.0756172868922564
<s> for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. <e>	2.082914344174087
<s> his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad. <e>	2.2643433818337755
<s> he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered father is intentions. <e>	2.1404753938832455
<s> you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it. <e>	1.7349855784981525
<s> his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. <e>	1.8768203186469126
<s> after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt. <e>	2.0506506693597544

<s> her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. <e>	2.1648587511318973

<s> he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty. <e>	2.0087141521981136
<s> but when this subject was succeeded by his account of <title> wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. <e>	1.7646273624738222

<s> <title> and <title> gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant is account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy. though lydia had never been a favourite with them <title> and <title> gardiner could not but be deeply affected. <e>	1.8914563132270077

<s> had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure. <e>	1.9784673943677251
<s> an hour however saw the whole completed and <title> gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn. <e>	2.1213435383089947

<s> and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well <e>	1.7525901702940745

<s> but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good. <e>	2.301593140092633
<s> lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father is behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter. <e>	1.9143097379118903
<s> but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage <e>	2.0936372142044206
<s> it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sister is sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. <e>	2.046713159003273

<s> perhaps i am not doing her justice. <e>	2.4584609684020116
<s> but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. <e>	1.9113239726961067
<s> since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head. <e>	1.9941663013878146

<s> and do you really know all this <e>	2.1298990190536977
<s> cried <title> gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive. <e>	2.163389226573656
<s> i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring. <e>	2.1068840643773252
<s> i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to <title> darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. <e>	2.220559246625079
<s> and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless. <e>	2.181797860183963

<s> i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. <e>	2.0768412912005965
<s> when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were. <e>	1.900515384226887
<s> every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites. <e>	1.7439311444699133
<s> it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey. <e>	1.7804323026613345
<s> fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness. <e>	1.7887675089986828

<s> it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations. <e>	2.2208543460665915
<s> the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome. <e>	1.810451830045786
<s> elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mother is apartment immediately met her. <e>	1.8449037869065237

<s> if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her. <e>	2.1743684359225184
<s> why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight <e>	2.0522077792383526
<s> i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after. <e>	2.311837831355889

<s> though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject. <e>	1.9751591225936054

<s> as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of. <e>	1.8927885689099386

<s> then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex. <e>	1.7003849908499544

<s> from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. <e>	1.8325652276161595

<s> he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. <e>	1.9122308765433598

<s> he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us. <e>	2.012476911502111
<s> there is a lady it seems a <title> younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what. <e>	2.0410784737566314

<s> but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due. <e>	1.8535295133751999

<s> his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased. <e>	1.9861652097392966
<s> the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above. <e>	2.600677326481609
<s> it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham is character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. <e>	2.201883903988951
<s> but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair. <e>	2.015191879959536

<s> he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. <e>	1.7296341055833315
