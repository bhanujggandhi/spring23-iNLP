<sos> stately  plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead  bearing a bowl of <eos>
<sos> lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed  a yellow <eos>
<sos> dressinggown  ungirdled  was sustained gently behind him on the mild <eos>
<sos> morning air  he held the bowl aloft and intoned  <eos>
<sos>  introibo ad altare dei  <eos>
<sos> halted  he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely  <eos>
<sos>  come up  kinch  come up  you fearful jesuit  <eos>
<sos> solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest  he faced about <eos>
<sos> and blessed gravely thrice the tower  the surrounding land and the <eos>
<sos> awaking mountains  then  catching sight of stephen dedalus  he bent <eos>
<sos> towards him and made rapid crosses in the air  gurgling in his throat <eos>
<sos> and shaking his head  stephen dedalus  displeased and sleepy  leaned <eos>
<sos> his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking <eos>
<sos> gurgling face that blessed him  equine in its length  and at the light <eos>
<sos> untonsured hair  grained and hued like pale oak  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the <eos>
<sos> bowl smartly  <eos>
<sos>  back to barracks  he said sternly  <eos>
<sos> he added in a preacher is tone  <eos>
<sos>  for this  o dearly beloved  is the genuine christine  body and soul <eos>
<sos> and blood and ouns  slow music  please  shut your eyes  gents  one <eos>
<sos> moment  a little trouble about those white corpuscles  silence  all  <eos>
<sos> he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call  then paused <eos>
<sos> awhile in rapt attention  his even white teeth glistening here and <eos>
<sos> there with gold points  chrysostomos  two strong shrill whistles <eos>
<sos> answered through the calm  <eos>
<sos>  thanks  old chap  he cried briskly  that will do nicely  switch off <eos>
<sos> the current  will you  <eos>
<sos> he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher  gathering <eos>
<sos> about his legs the loose folds of his gown  the plump shadowed face and <eos>
<sos> sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate  patron of arts in the middle ages  <eos>
<sos> a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips  <eos>
<sos>  the mockery of it  he said gaily  your absurd name  an ancient greek  <eos>
<sos> he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet  <eos>
<sos> laughing to himself  stephen dedalus stepped up  followed him wearily <eos>
<sos> halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest  watching him still as <eos>
<sos> he propped his mirror on the parapet  dipped the brush in the bowl and <eos>
<sos> lathered cheeks and neck  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan is gay voice went on  <eos>
<sos>  my name is absurd too  malachi mulligan  two dactyls  but it has a <eos>
<sos> hellenic ring  has not it  tripping and sunny like the buck himself  we <eos>
<sos> must go to athens  will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out <eos>
<sos> twenty quid  <eos>
<sos> he laid the brush aside and  laughing with delight  cried  <eos>
<sos>  will he come  the jejune jesuit  <eos>
<sos> ceasing  he began to shave with care  <eos>
<sos>  tell me  mulligan  stephen said quietly  <eos>
<sos>  yes  my love  <eos>
<sos>  how long is haines going to stay in this tower  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder  <eos>
<sos>  god  is not he dreadful  he said frankly  a ponderous saxon  he thinks <eos>
<sos> you re not a gentleman  god  these bloody english  bursting with money <eos>
<sos> and indigestion  because he comes from oxford  you know  dedalus  you <eos>
<sos> have the real oxford manner  he ca not make you out  o  my name for you <eos>
<sos> is the best  kinch  the knife blade  <eos>
<sos> he shaved warily over his chin  <eos>
<sos>  he was raving all night about a black panther  stephen said  where is <eos>
<sos> his guncase  <eos>
<sos>  a woful lunatic  mulligan said  were you in a funk  <eos>
<sos>  i was  stephen said with energy and growing fear  out here in the dark <eos>
<sos> with a man i do not know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a <eos>
<sos> black panther  you saved men from drowning  i am not a hero  however  if <eos>
<sos> he stays on here i am off  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade  he hopped down <eos>
<sos> from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily  <eos>
<sos>  scutter  he cried thickly  <eos>
<sos> he came over to the gunrest and  thrusting a hand into stephen is upper <eos>
<sos> pocket  said  <eos>
<sos>  lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor  <eos>
<sos> stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a <eos>
<sos> dirty crumpled handkerchief  buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly  <eos>
<sos> then  gazing over the handkerchief  he said  <eos>
<sos>  the bard is noserag  a new art colour for our irish poets  snotgreen  <eos>
<sos> you can almost taste it  ca not you  <eos>
<sos> he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay  his fair <eos>
<sos> oakpale hair stirring slightly  <eos>
<sos>  god  he said quietly  is not the sea what algy calls it  a great sweet <eos>
<sos> mother  the snotgreen sea  the scrotumtightening sea  _epi oinopa <eos>
<sos> ponton_  ah  dedalus  the greeks  i must teach you  you must read them <eos>
<sos> in the original  thalatta  thalatta  she is our great sweet mother  <eos>
<sos> come and look  <eos>
<sos> stephen stood up and went over to the parapet  leaning on it he looked <eos>
<sos> down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of <eos>
<sos> kingstown  <eos>
<sos>  our mighty mother  buck mulligan said  <eos>
<sos> he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephen is <eos>
<sos> face  <eos>
<sos>  the aunt thinks you killed your mother  he said  that is why she wo not <eos>
<sos> let me have anything to do with you  <eos>
<sos>  someone killed her  stephen said gloomily  <eos>
<sos>  you could have knelt down  damn it  kinch  when your dying mother <eos>
<sos> asked you  buck mulligan said  i am hyperborean as much as you  but to <eos>
<sos> think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and <eos>
<sos> pray for her  and you refused  there is something sinister in you     <eos>
<sos> he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek  a tolerant <eos>
<sos> smile curled his lips  <eos>
<sos>  but a lovely mummer  he murmured to himself  kinch  the loveliest <eos>
<sos> mummer of them all  <eos>
<sos> he shaved evenly and with care  in silence  seriously  <eos>
<sos> stephen  an elbow rested on the jagged granite  leaned his palm against <eos>
<sos> his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat sleeve  <eos>
<sos> pain  that was not yet the pain of love  fretted his heart  silently  <eos>
<sos> in a dream she had come to him after her death  her wasted body within <eos>
<sos> its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood  <eos>
<sos> her breath  that had bent upon him  mute  reproachful  a faint odour of <eos>
<sos> wetted ashes  across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a <eos>
<sos> great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him  the ring of bay and <eos>
<sos> skyline held a dull green mass of liquid  a bowl of white china had <eos>
<sos> stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had <eos>
<sos> torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade  <eos>
<sos>  ah  poor dogsbody  he said in a kind voice  i must give you a shirt <eos>
<sos> and a few noserags  how are the secondhand breeks  <eos>
<sos>  they fit well enough  stephen answered  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip  <eos>
<sos>  the mockery of it  he said contentedly  secondleg they should be  god <eos>
<sos> knows what poxy bowsy left them off  i have a lovely pair with a hair <eos>
<sos> stripe  grey  you ll look spiffing in them  i am not joking  kinch  you <eos>
<sos> look damn well when you re dressed  <eos>
<sos>  thanks  stephen said  i ca not wear them if they are grey  <eos>
<sos>  he ca not wear them  buck mulligan told his face in the mirror  <eos>
<sos> etiquette is etiquette  he kills his mother but he ca not wear grey <eos>
<sos> trousers  <eos>
<sos> he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the <eos>
<sos> smooth skin  <eos>
<sos> stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its <eos>
<sos> smokeblue mobile eyes  <eos>
<sos>  that fellow i was with in the ship last night  said buck mulligan  <eos>
<sos> says you have g  p  i  he is up in dottyville with connolly norman  <eos>
<sos> general paralysis of the insane  <eos>
<sos> he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings <eos>
<sos> abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea  his curling shaven lips <eos>
<sos> laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth  laughter seized <eos>
<sos> all his strong wellknit trunk  <eos>
<sos>  look at yourself  he said  you dreadful bard  <eos>
<sos> stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him  cleft by <eos>
<sos> a crooked crack  hair on end  as he and others see me  who chose this <eos>
<sos> face for me  this dogsbody to rid of vermin  it asks me too  <eos>
<sos>  i pinched it out of the skivvy is room  buck mulligan said  it does her <eos>
<sos> all right  the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi  <eos>
<sos> lead him not into temptation  and her name is ursula  <eos>
<sos> laughing again  he brought the mirror away from stephen is peering eyes  <eos>
<sos>  the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror  he said  if <eos>
<sos> wilde were only alive to see you  <eos>
<sos> drawing back and pointing  stephen said with bitterness  <eos>
<sos>  it is a symbol of irish art  the cracked lookingglass of a servant  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephen is and walked with him <eos>
<sos> round the tower  his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he <eos>
<sos> had thrust them  <eos>
<sos>  it is not fair to tease you like that  kinch  is it  he said kindly  <eos>
<sos> god knows you have more spirit than any of them  <eos>
<sos> parried again  he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his  the <eos>
<sos> cold steel pen  <eos>
<sos>  cracked lookingglass of a servant  tell that to the oxy chap <eos>
<sos> downstairs and touch him for a guinea  he is stinking with money and <eos>
<sos> thinks you re not a gentleman  his old fellow made his tin by selling <eos>
<sos> jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other  god  kinch  if you and <eos>
<sos> i could only work together we might do something for the island  <eos>
<sos> hellenise it  <eos>
<sos> cranly is arm  his arm  <eos>
<sos>  and to think of your having to beg from these swine  i am the only one <eos>
<sos> that knows what you are  why do not you trust me more  what have you up <eos>
<sos> your nose against me  is it haines  if he makes any noise here i ll <eos>
<sos> bring down seymour and we ll give him a ragging worse than they gave <eos>
<sos> clive kempthorpe  <eos>
<sos> young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpe is rooms  palefaces  <eos>
<sos> they hold their ribs with laughter  one clasping another  o  i shall <eos>
<sos> expire  break the news to her gently  aubrey  i shall die  with slit <eos>
<sos> ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the <eos>
<sos> table  with trousers down at heels  chased by ades of magdalen with the <eos>
<sos> tailor is shears  a scared calf is face gilded with marmalade  i do not <eos>
<sos> want to be debagged  do not you play the giddy ox with me  <eos>
<sos> shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle  a deaf <eos>
<sos> gardener  aproned  masked with matthew arnold is face  pushes his mower <eos>
<sos> on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms  <eos>
<sos> to ourselves    new paganism    omphalos  <eos>
<sos>  let him stay  stephen said  there is nothing wrong with him except at <eos>
<sos> night  <eos>
<sos>  then what is it  buck mulligan asked impatiently  cough it up  i am <eos>
<sos> quite frank with you  what have you against me now  <eos>
<sos> they halted  looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on <eos>
<sos> the water like the snout of a sleeping whale  stephen freed his arm <eos>
<sos> quietly  <eos>
<sos>  do you wish me to tell you  he asked  <eos>
<sos>  yes  what is it  buck mulligan answered  i do not remember anything  <eos>
<sos> he looked in stephen is face as he spoke  a light wind passed his brow  <eos>
<sos> fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of <eos>
<sos> anxiety in his eyes  <eos>
<sos> stephen  depressed by his own voice  said  <eos>
<sos>  do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mother is <eos>
<sos> death  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan frowned quickly and said  <eos>
<sos>  what  where  i ca not remember anything  i remember only ideas and <eos>
<sos> sensations  why  what happened in the name of god  <eos>
<sos>  you were making tea  stephen said  and went across the landing to get <eos>
<sos> more hot water  your mother and some visitor came out of the <eos>
<sos> drawingroom  she asked you who was in your room  <eos>
<sos>  yes  buck mulligan said  what did i say  i forget  <eos>
<sos>  you said  stephen answered  _o  it is only dedalus whose mother is <eos>
<sos> beastly dead _ <eos>
<sos> a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck <eos>
<sos> mulligan is cheek  <eos>
<sos>  did i say that  he asked  well  what harm is that  <eos>
<sos> he shook his constraint from him nervously  <eos>
<sos>  and what is death  he asked  your mother is or yours or my own  you saw <eos>
<sos> only your mother die  i see them pop off every day in the mater and <eos>
<sos> richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom  it is a beastly <eos>
<sos> thing and nothing else  it simply does not matter  you would not kneel <eos>
<sos> down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you  why  <eos>
<sos> because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you  only it is injected <eos>
<sos> the wrong way  to me it is all a mockery and beastly  her cerebral lobes <eos>
<sos> are not functioning  she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks <eos>
<sos> buttercups off the quilt  humour her till it is over  you crossed her <eos>
<sos> last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i do not whinge like <eos>
<sos> some hired mute from lalouette is  absurd  i suppose i did say it  i <eos>
<sos> did not mean to offend the memory of your mother  <eos>
<sos> he had spoken himself into boldness  stephen  shielding the gaping <eos>
<sos> wounds which the words had left in his heart  said very coldly  <eos>
<sos>  i am not thinking of the offence to my mother  <eos>
<sos>  of what then  buck mulligan asked  <eos>
<sos>  of the offence to me  stephen answered  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan swung round on his heel  <eos>
<sos>  o  an impossible person  he exclaimed  <eos>
<sos> he walked off quickly round the parapet  stephen stood at his post  <eos>
<sos> gazing over the calm sea towards the headland  sea and headland now <eos>
<sos> grew dim  pulses were beating in his eyes  veiling their sight  and he <eos>
<sos> felt the fever of his cheeks  <eos>
<sos> a voice within the tower called loudly  <eos>
<sos>  are you up there  mulligan  <eos>
<sos>  i am coming  buck mulligan answered  <eos>
<sos> he turned towards stephen and said  <eos>
<sos>  look at the sea  what does it care about offences  chuck loyola  <eos>
<sos> kinch  and come on down  the sassenach wants his morning rashers  <eos>
<sos> his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase  level <eos>
<sos> with the roof  <eos>
<sos>  do not mope over it all day  he said  i am inconsequent  give up the <eos>
<sos> moody brooding  <eos>
<sos> his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of <eos>
<sos> the stairhead  <eos>
<sos> and no more turn aside and brood <eos>
<sos> upon love is bitter mystery <eos>
<sos> for fergus rules the brazen cars  <eos>
<sos> woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the <eos>
<sos> stairhead seaward where he gazed  inshore and farther out the mirror of <eos>
<sos> water whitened  spurned by lightshod hurrying feet  white breast of the <eos>
<sos> dim sea  the twining stresses  two by two  a hand plucking the <eos>
<sos> harpstrings  merging their twining chords  wavewhite wedded words <eos>
<sos> shimmering on the dim tide  <eos>
<sos> a cloud began to cover the sun slowly  wholly  shadowing the bay in <eos>
<sos> deeper green  it lay beneath him  a bowl of bitter waters  fergus  <eos>
<sos> song  i sang it alone in the house  holding down the long dark chords  <eos>
<sos> her door was open  she wanted to hear my music  silent with awe and <eos>
<sos> pity i went to her bedside  she was crying in her wretched bed  for <eos>
<sos> those words  stephen  love is bitter mystery  <eos>
<sos> where now  <eos>
<sos> her secrets  old featherfans  tasselled dancecards  powdered with musk  <eos>
<sos> a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer  a birdcage hung in the <eos>
<sos> sunny window of her house when she was a girl  she heard old royce sing <eos>
<sos> in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he <eos>
<sos> sang  <eos>
<sos> i am the boy <eos>
<sos> that can enjoy <eos>
<sos> invisibility  <eos>
<sos> phantasmal mirth  folded away  muskperfumed  <eos>
<sos> and no more turn aside and brood  <eos>
<sos> folded away in the memory of nature with her toys  memories beset his <eos>
<sos> brooding brain  her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had <eos>
<sos> approached the sacrament  a cored apple  filled with brown sugar  <eos>
<sos> roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening  her shapely <eos>
<sos> fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children is <eos>
<sos> shirts  <eos>
<sos> in a dream  silently  she had come to him  her wasted body within its <eos>
<sos> loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood  her breath  <eos>
<sos> bent over him with mute secret words  a faint odour of wetted ashes  <eos>
<sos> her glazing eyes  staring out of death  to shake and bend my soul  on <eos>
<sos> me alone  the ghostcandle to light her agony  ghostly light on the <eos>
<sos> tortured face  her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror  while all <eos>
<sos> prayed on their knees  her eyes on me to strike me down  _liliata <eos>
<sos> rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet  iubilantium te virginum <eos>
<sos> chorus excipiat _ <eos>
<sos> ghoul  chewer of corpses  <eos>
<sos> no  mother  let me be and let me live  <eos>
<sos>  kinch ahoy  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan is voice sang from within the tower  it came nearer up the <eos>
<sos> staircase  calling again  stephen  still trembling at his soul is cry  <eos>
<sos> heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words  <eos>
<sos>  dedalus  come down  like a good mosey  breakfast is ready  haines is <eos>
<sos> apologising for waking us last night  it is all right  <eos>
<sos>  i am coming  stephen said  turning  <eos>
<sos>  do  for jesus  sake  buck mulligan said  for my sake and for all our <eos>
<sos> sakes  <eos>
<sos> his head disappeared and reappeared  <eos>
<sos>  i told him your symbol of irish art  he says it is very clever  touch <eos>
<sos> him for a quid  will you  a guinea  i mean  <eos>
<sos>  i get paid this morning  stephen said  <eos>
<sos>  the school kip  buck mulligan said  how much  four quid  lend us one  <eos>
<sos>  if you want it  stephen said  <eos>
<sos>  four shining sovereigns  buck mulligan cried with delight  we ll have <eos>
<sos> a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids  four omnipotent <eos>
<sos> sovereigns  <eos>
<sos> he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs  singing out of <eos>
<sos> tune with a cockney accent  <eos>
<sos> o  wo not we have a merry time  <eos>
<sos> drinking whisky  beer and wine  <eos>
<sos> on coronation  <eos>
<sos> coronation day  <eos>
<sos> o  wo not we have a merry time <eos>
<sos> on coronation day  <eos>
<sos> warm sunshine merrying over the sea  the nickel shavingbowl shone  <eos>
<sos> forgotten  on the parapet  why should i bring it down  or leave it <eos>
<sos> there all day  forgotten friendship  <eos>
<sos> he went over to it  held it in his hands awhile  feeling its coolness  <eos>
<sos> smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck  <eos>
<sos> so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes  i am another now <eos>
<sos> and yet the same  a servant too  a server of a servant  <eos>
<sos> in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligan is gowned form <eos>
<sos> moved briskly to and fro about the hearth  hiding and revealing its <eos>
<sos> yellow glow  two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor <eos>
<sos> from the high barbacans  and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of <eos>
<sos> coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated  turning  <eos>
<sos>  we ll be choked  buck mulligan said  haines  open that door  will you  <eos>
<sos> stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker  a tall figure rose from the <eos>
<sos> hammock where it had been sitting  went to the doorway and pulled open <eos>
<sos> the inner doors  <eos>
<sos>  have you the key  a voice asked  <eos>
<sos>  dedalus has it  buck mulligan said  janey mack  i am choked  <eos>
<sos> he howled  without looking up from the fire  <eos>
<sos>  kinch  <eos>
<sos>  it is in the lock  stephen said  coming forward  <eos>
<sos> the key scraped round harshly twice and  when the heavy door had been <eos>
<sos> set ajar  welcome light and bright air entered  haines stood at the <eos>
<sos> doorway  looking out  stephen haled his upended valise to the table and <eos>
<sos> sat down to wait  buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside <eos>
<sos> him  then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table  set <eos>
<sos> them down heavily and sighed with relief  <eos>
<sos>  i am melting  he said  as the candle remarked when    but  hush  not a <eos>
<sos> word more on that subject  kinch  wake up  bread  butter  honey  <eos>
<sos> haines  come in  the grub is ready  bless us  o lord  and these thy <eos>
<sos> gifts  where is the sugar  o  jay  there is no milk  <eos>
<sos> stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from <eos>
<sos> the locker  buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet  <eos>
<sos>  what sort of a kip is this  he said  i told her to come after eight  <eos>
<sos>  we can drink it black  stephen said thirstily  there is a lemon in the <eos>
<sos> locker  <eos>
<sos>  o  damn you and your paris fads  buck mulligan said  i want sandycove <eos>
<sos> milk  <eos>
<sos> haines came in from the doorway and said quietly  <eos>
<sos>  that woman is coming up with the milk  <eos>
<sos>  the blessings of god on you  buck mulligan cried  jumping up from his <eos>
<sos> chair  sit down  pour out the tea there  the sugar is in the bag  here  <eos>
<sos> i ca not go fumbling at the damned eggs  <eos>
<sos> he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three <eos>
<sos> plates  saying  <eos>
<sos>  in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti  <eos>
<sos> haines sat down to pour out the tea  <eos>
<sos>  i am giving you two lumps each  he said  but  i say  mulligan  you do <eos>
<sos> make strong tea  do not you  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan  hewing thick slices from the loaf  said in an old <eos>
<sos> woman is wheedling voice  <eos>
<sos>  when i makes tea i makes tea  as old mother grogan said  and when i <eos>
<sos> makes water i makes water  <eos>
<sos>  by jove  it is tea  haines said  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling  <eos>
<sos>  so i do  mrs cahill  says she  begob  ma am  says mrs cahill  _god <eos>
<sos> send you do not make them in the one pot _ <eos>
<sos> he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread  impaled <eos>
<sos> on his knife  <eos>
<sos>  that is folk  he said very earnestly  for your book  haines  five lines <eos>
<sos> of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of <eos>
<sos> dundrum  printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind  <eos>
<sos> he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice  lifting his <eos>
<sos> brows  <eos>
<sos>  can you recall  brother  is mother grogan is tea and water pot spoken <eos>
<sos> of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads  <eos>
<sos>  i doubt it  said stephen gravely  <eos>
<sos>  do you now  buck mulligan said in the same tone  your reasons  pray  <eos>
<sos>  i fancy  stephen said as he ate  it did not exist in or out of the <eos>
<sos> mabinogion  mother grogan was  one imagines  a kinswoman of mary ann  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan is face smiled with delight  <eos>
<sos>  charming  he said in a finical sweet voice  showing his white teeth <eos>
<sos> and blinking his eyes pleasantly  do you think she was  quite charming  <eos>
<sos> then  suddenly overclouding all his features  he growled in a hoarsened <eos>
<sos> rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf  <eos>
<sos> _ for old mary ann <eos>
<sos> she does not care a damn  <eos>
<sos> but  hising up her petticoats   _ <eos>
<sos> he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned  <eos>
<sos> the doorway was darkened by an entering form  <eos>
<sos>  the milk  sir  <eos>
<sos>  come in  ma am  mulligan said  kinch  get the jug  <eos>
<sos> an old woman came forward and stood by stephen is elbow  <eos>
<sos>  that is a lovely morning  sir  she said  glory be to god  <eos>
<sos>  to whom  mulligan said  glancing at her  ah  to be sure  <eos>
<sos> stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker  <eos>
<sos>  the islanders  mulligan said to haines casually  speak frequently of <eos>
<sos> the collector of prepuces  <eos>
<sos>  how much  sir  asked the old woman  <eos>
<sos>  a quart  stephen said  <eos>
<sos> he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white <eos>
<sos> milk  not hers  old shrunken paps  she poured again a measureful and a <eos>
<sos> tilly  old and secret she had entered from a morning world  maybe a <eos>
<sos> messenger  she praised the goodness of the milk  pouring it out  <eos>
<sos> crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field  a witch on <eos>
<sos> her toadstool  her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs  they <eos>
<sos> lowed about her whom they knew  dewsilky cattle  silk of the kine and <eos>
<sos> poor old woman  names given her in old times  a wandering crone  lowly <eos>
<sos> form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer  their <eos>
<sos> common cuckquean  a messenger from the secret morning  to serve or to <eos>
<sos> upbraid  whether he could not tell  but scorned to beg her favour  <eos>
<sos>  it is indeed  ma am  buck mulligan said  pouring milk into their cups  <eos>
<sos>  taste it  sir  she said  <eos>
<sos> he drank at her bidding  <eos>
<sos>  if we could live on good food like that  he said to her somewhat <eos>
<sos> loudly  we would not have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten <eos>
<sos> guts  living in a bogswamp  eating cheap food and the streets paved <eos>
<sos> with dust  horsedung and consumptives  spits  <eos>
<sos>  are you a medical student  sir  the old woman asked  <eos>
<sos>  i am  ma am  buck mulligan answered  <eos>
<sos>  look at that now  she said  <eos>
<sos> stephen listened in scornful silence  she bows her old head to a voice <eos>
<sos> that speaks to her loudly  her bonesetter  her medicineman  me she <eos>
<sos> slights  to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there <eos>
<sos> is of her but her woman is unclean loins  of man is flesh made not in <eos>
<sos> god is likeness  the serpent is prey  and to the loud voice that now bids <eos>
<sos> her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes  <eos>
<sos>  do you understand what he says  stephen asked her  <eos>
<sos>  is it french you are talking  sir  the old woman said to haines  <eos>
<sos> haines spoke to her again a longer speech  confidently  <eos>
<sos>  irish  buck mulligan said  is there gaelic on you  <eos>
<sos>  i thought it was irish  she said  by the sound of it  are you from the <eos>
<sos> west  sir  <eos>
<sos>  i am an englishman  haines answered  <eos>
<sos>  he is english  buck mulligan said  and he thinks we ought to speak <eos>
<sos> irish in ireland  <eos>
<sos>  sure we ought to  the old woman said  and i am ashamed i do not speak <eos>
<sos> the language myself  i am told it is a grand language by them that knows  <eos>
<sos>  grand is no name for it  said buck mulligan  wonderful entirely  fill <eos>
<sos> us out some more tea  kinch  would you like a cup  ma am  <eos>
<sos>  no  thank you  sir  the old woman said  slipping the ring of the <eos>
<sos> milkcan on her forearm and about to go  <eos>
<sos> haines said to her  <eos>
<sos>  have you your bill  we had better pay her  mulligan  had not we  <eos>
<sos> stephen filled again the three cups  <eos>
<sos>  bill  sir  she said  halting  well  it is seven mornings a pint at <eos>
<sos> twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three <eos>
<sos> mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling  that is a <eos>
<sos> shilling and one and two is two and two  sir  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan sighed and  having filled his mouth with a crust thickly <eos>
<sos> buttered on both sides  stretched forth his legs and began to search <eos>
<sos> his trouser pockets  <eos>
<sos>  pay up and look pleasant  haines said to him  smiling  <eos>
<sos> stephen filled a third cup  a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the <eos>
<sos> thick rich milk  buck mulligan brought up a florin  twisted it round in <eos>
<sos> his fingers and cried  <eos>
<sos>  a miracle  <eos>
<sos> he passed it along the table towards the old woman  saying  <eos>
<sos>  ask nothing more of me  sweet  all i can give you i give  <eos>
<sos> stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand  <eos>
<sos>  we ll owe twopence  he said  <eos>
<sos>  time enough  sir  she said  taking the coin  time enough  good <eos>
<sos> morning  sir  <eos>
<sos> she curtseyed and went out  followed by buck mulligan is tender chant  <eos>
<sos> _ heart of my heart  were it more  <eos>
<sos> more would be laid at your feet _ <eos>
<sos> he turned to stephen and said  <eos>
<sos>  seriously  dedalus  i am stony  hurry out to your school kip and bring <eos>
<sos> us back some money  today the bards must drink and junket  ireland <eos>
<sos> expects that every man this day will do his duty  <eos>
<sos>  that reminds me  haines said  rising  that i have to visit your <eos>
<sos> national library today  <eos>
<sos>  our swim first  buck mulligan said  <eos>
<sos> he turned to stephen and asked blandly  <eos>
<sos>  is this the day for your monthly wash  kinch  <eos>
<sos> then he said to haines  <eos>
<sos>  the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month  <eos>
<sos>  all ireland is washed by the gulfstream  stephen said as he let honey <eos>
<sos> trickle over a slice of the loaf  <eos>
<sos> haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the <eos>
<sos> loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke  <eos>
<sos>  i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me  <eos>
<sos> speaking to me  they wash and tub and scrub  agenbite of inwit  <eos>
<sos> conscience  yet here is a spot  <eos>
<sos>  that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol <eos>
<sos> of irish art is deuced good  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan kicked stephen is foot under the table and said with <eos>
<sos> warmth of tone  <eos>
<sos>  wait till you hear him on hamlet  haines  <eos>
<sos>  well  i mean it  haines said  still speaking to stephen  i was just <eos>
<sos> thinking of it when that poor old creature came in  <eos>
<sos>  would i make any money by it  stephen asked  <eos>
<sos> haines laughed and  as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of <eos>
<sos> the hammock  said  <eos>
<sos>  i do not know  i am sure  <eos>
<sos> he strolled out to the doorway  buck mulligan bent across to stephen <eos>
<sos> and said with coarse vigour  <eos>
<sos>  you put your hoof in it now  what did you say that for  <eos>
<sos>  well  stephen said  the problem is to get money  from whom  from the <eos>
<sos> milkwoman or from him  it is a toss up  i think  <eos>
<sos>  i blow him out about you  buck mulligan said  and then you come along <eos>
<sos> with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes  <eos>
<sos>  i see little hope  stephen said  from her or from him  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephen is arm  <eos>
<sos>  from me  kinch  he said  <eos>
<sos> in a suddenly changed tone he added  <eos>
<sos>  to tell you the god is truth i think you re right  damn all else they <eos>
<sos> are good for  why do not you play them as i do  to hell with them all  <eos>
<sos> let us get out of the kip  <eos>
<sos> he stood up  gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown  saying <eos>
<sos> resignedly  <eos>
<sos>  mulligan is stripped of his garments  <eos>
<sos> he emptied his pockets on to the table  <eos>
<sos>  there is your snotrag  he said  <eos>
<sos> and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them  <eos>
<sos> chiding them  and to his dangling watchchain  his hands plunged and <eos>
<sos> rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief  god  <eos>
<sos> we ll simply have to dress the character  i want puce gloves and green <eos>
<sos> boots  contradiction  do i contradict myself  very well then  i <eos>
<sos> contradict myself  mercurial malachi  a limp black missile flew out of <eos>
<sos> his talking hands  <eos>
<sos>  and there is your latin quarter hat  he said  <eos>
<sos> stephen picked it up and put it on  haines called to them from the <eos>
<sos> doorway  <eos>
<sos>  are you coming  you fellows  <eos>
<sos>  i am ready  buck mulligan answered  going towards the door  come out  <eos>
<sos> kinch  you have eaten all we left  i suppose  resigned he passed out <eos>
<sos> with grave words and gait  saying  wellnigh with sorrow  <eos>
<sos>  and going forth he met butterly  <eos>
<sos> stephen  taking his ashplant from its leaningplace  followed them out <eos>
<sos> and  as they went down the ladder  pulled to the slow iron door and <eos>
<sos> locked it  he put the huge key in his inner pocket  <eos>
<sos> at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked  <eos>
<sos>  did you bring the key  <eos>
<sos>  i have it  stephen said  preceding them  <eos>
<sos> he walked on  behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy <eos>
<sos> bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses  <eos>
<sos>  down  sir  how dare you  sir  <eos>
<sos> haines asked  <eos>
<sos>  do you pay rent for this tower  <eos>
<sos>  twelve quid  buck mulligan said  <eos>
<sos>  to the secretary of state for war  stephen added over his shoulder  <eos>
<sos> they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last  <eos>
<sos>  rather bleak in wintertime  i should say  martello you call it  <eos>
<sos>  billy pitt had them built  buck mulligan said  when the french were on <eos>
<sos> the sea  but ours is the omphalos  <eos>
<sos>  what is your idea of hamlet  haines asked stephen  <eos>
<sos>  no  no  buck mulligan shouted in pain  i am not equal to thomas aquinas <eos>
<sos> and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up  wait till i <eos>
<sos> have a few pints in me first  <eos>
<sos> he turned to stephen  saying  as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his <eos>
<sos> primrose waistcoat  <eos>
<sos>  you could not manage it under three pints  kinch  could you  <eos>
<sos>  it has waited so long  stephen said listlessly  it can wait longer  <eos>
<sos>  you pique my curiosity  haines said amiably  is it some paradox  <eos>
<sos>  pooh  buck mulligan said  we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes  <eos>
<sos> it is quite simple  he proves by algebra that hamlet is grandson is <eos>
<sos> shakespeare is grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own <eos>
<sos> father  <eos>
<sos>  what  haines said  beginning to point at stephen  he himself  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and  bending in <eos>
<sos> loose laughter  said to stephen is ear  <eos>
<sos>  o  shade of kinch the elder  japhet in search of a father  <eos>
<sos>  we re always tired in the morning  stephen said to haines  and it is <eos>
<sos> rather long to tell  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan  walking forward again  raised his hands  <eos>
<sos>  the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus  he said  <eos>
<sos>  i mean to say  haines explained to stephen as they followed  this <eos>
<sos> tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore  _that <eos>
<sos> beetles o er his base into the sea _ is not it  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did <eos>
<sos> not speak  in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in <eos>
<sos> cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires  <eos>
<sos>  it is a wonderful tale  haines said  bringing them to halt again  <eos>
<sos> eyes  pale as the sea the wind had freshened  paler  firm and prudent  <eos>
<sos> the seas  ruler  he gazed southward over the bay  empty save for the <eos>
<sos> smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail <eos>
<sos> tacking by the muglins  <eos>
<sos>  i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere  he said bemused  <eos>
<sos> the father and the son idea  the son striving to be atoned with the <eos>
<sos> father  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face  he looked <eos>
<sos> at them  his wellshaped mouth open happily  his eyes  from which he had <eos>
<sos> suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense  blinking with mad gaiety  he moved <eos>
<sos> a doll is head to and fro  the brims of his panama hat quivering  and <eos>
<sos> began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice  <eos>
<sos> _ i am the queerest young fellow that ever you heard  <eos>
<sos> my mother is a jew  my father is a bird  <eos>
<sos> with joseph the joiner i cannot agree  <eos>
<sos> so here is to disciples and calvary _ <eos>
<sos> he held up a forefinger of warning  <eos>
<sos> _ if anyone thinks that i am not divine <eos>
<sos> he ll get no free drinks when i am making the wine <eos>
<sos> but have to drink water and wish it were plain <eos>
<sos> that i make when the wine becomes water again _ <eos>
<sos> he tugged swiftly at stephen is ashplant in farewell and  running <eos>
<sos> forward to a brow of the cliff  fluttered his hands at his sides like <eos>
<sos> fins or wings of one about to rise in the air  and chanted  <eos>
<sos> _ goodbye  now  goodbye  write down all i said <eos>
<sos> and tell tom  dick and harry i rose from the dead  <eos>
<sos> what is bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly <eos>
<sos> and olivet is breezy    goodbye  now  goodbye _ <eos>
<sos> he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole  fluttering his <eos>
<sos> winglike hands  leaping nimbly  mercury is hat quivering in the fresh <eos>
<sos> wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries  <eos>
<sos> haines  who had been laughing guardedly  walked on beside stephen and <eos>
<sos> said  <eos>
<sos>  we ought not to laugh  i suppose  he is rather blasphemous  i am not a <eos>
<sos> believer myself  that is to say  still his gaiety takes the harm out of <eos>
<sos> it somehow  does not it  what did he call it  joseph the joiner  <eos>
<sos>  the ballad of joking jesus  stephen answered  <eos>
<sos>  o  haines said  you have heard it before  <eos>
<sos>  three times a day  after meals  stephen said drily  <eos>
<sos>  you re not a believer  are you  haines asked  i mean  a believer in <eos>
<sos> the narrow sense of the word  creation from nothing and miracles and a <eos>
<sos> personal god  <eos>
<sos>  there is only one sense of the word  it seems to me  stephen said  <eos>
<sos> haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a <eos>
<sos> green stone  he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it  <eos>
<sos>  thank you  stephen said  taking a cigarette  <eos>
<sos> haines helped himself and snapped the case to  he put it back in his <eos>
<sos> sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox  sprang <eos>
<sos> it open too  and  having lit his cigarette  held the flaming spunk <eos>
<sos> towards stephen in the shell of his hands  <eos>
<sos>  yes  of course  he said  as they went on again  either you believe or <eos>
<sos> you do not  is not it  personally i could not stomach that idea of a <eos>
<sos> personal god  you do not stand for that  i suppose  <eos>
<sos>  you behold in me  stephen said with grim displeasure  a horrible <eos>
<sos> example of free thought  <eos>
<sos> he walked on  waiting to be spoken to  trailing his ashplant by his <eos>
<sos> side  its ferrule followed lightly on the path  squealing at his heels  <eos>
<sos> my familiar  after me  calling  steeeeeeeeeeeephen  a wavering line <eos>
<sos> along the path  they will walk on it tonight  coming here in the dark  <eos>
<sos> he wants that key  it is mine  i paid the rent  now i eat his salt <eos>
<sos> bread  give him the key too  all  he will ask for it  that was in his <eos>
<sos> eyes  <eos>
<sos>  after all  haines began    <eos>
<sos> stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was <eos>
<sos> not all unkind  <eos>
<sos>  after all  i should think you are able to free yourself  you are your <eos>
<sos> own master  it seems to me  <eos>
<sos>  i am a servant of two masters  stephen said  an english and an <eos>
<sos> italian  <eos>
<sos>  italian  haines said  <eos>
<sos> a crazy queen  old and jealous  kneel down before me  <eos>
<sos>  and a third  stephen said  there is who wants me for odd jobs  <eos>
<sos>  italian  haines said again  what do you mean  <eos>
<sos>  the imperial british state  stephen answered  his colour rising  and <eos>
<sos> the holy roman catholic and apostolic church  <eos>
<sos> haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he <eos>
<sos> spoke  <eos>
<sos>  i can quite understand that  he said calmly  an irishman must think <eos>
<sos> like that  i daresay  we feel in england that we have treated you <eos>
<sos> rather unfairly  it seems history is to blame  <eos>
<sos> the proud potent titles clanged over stephen is memory the triumph of <eos>
<sos> their brazen bells  _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam <eos>
<sos> ecclesiam _ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own <eos>
<sos> rare thoughts  a chemistry of stars  symbol of the apostles in the mass <eos>
<sos> for pope marcellus  the voices blended  singing alone loud in <eos>
<sos> affirmation  and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church <eos>
<sos> militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs  a horde of heresies <eos>
<sos> fleeing with mitres awry  photius and the brood of mockers of whom <eos>
<sos> mulligan was one  and arius  warring his life long upon the <eos>
<sos> consubstantiality of the son with the father  and valentine  spurning <eos>
<sos> christ is terrene body  and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who <eos>
<sos> held that the father was himself his own son  words mulligan had spoken <eos>
<sos> a moment since in mockery to the stranger  idle mockery  the void <eos>
<sos> awaits surely all them that weave the wind  a menace  a disarming and a <eos>
<sos> worsting from those embattled angels of the church  michael is host  who <eos>
<sos> defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their <eos>
<sos> shields  <eos>
<sos> hear  hear  prolonged applause  zut  nom de dieu  <eos>
<sos>  of course i am a britisher  haines is voice said  and i feel as one  i <eos>
<sos> do not want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either  <eos>
<sos> that is our national problem  i am afraid  just now  <eos>
<sos> two men stood at the verge of the cliff  watching  businessman  <eos>
<sos> boatman  <eos>
<sos>  she is making for bullock harbour  <eos>
<sos> the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain  <eos>
<sos>  there is five fathoms out there  he said  it ll be swept up that way <eos>
<sos> when the tide comes in about one  it is nine days today  <eos>
<sos> the man that was drowned  a sail veering about the blank bay waiting <eos>
<sos> for a swollen bundle to bob up  roll over to the sun a puffy face  <eos>
<sos> saltwhite  here i am  <eos>
<sos> they followed the winding path down to the creek  buck mulligan stood <eos>
<sos> on a stone  in shirtsleeves  his unclipped tie rippling over his <eos>
<sos> shoulder  a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him  moved slowly <eos>
<sos> frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water  <eos>
<sos>  is the brother with you  malachi  <eos>
<sos>  down in westmeath  with the bannons  <eos>
<sos>  still there  i got a card from bannon  says he found a sweet young <eos>
<sos> thing down there  photo girl he calls her  <eos>
<sos>  snapshot  eh  brief exposure  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots  an elderly man shot up near <eos>
<sos> the spur of rock a blowing red face  he scrambled up by the stones  <eos>
<sos> water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair  water <eos>
<sos> rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black <eos>
<sos> sagging loincloth  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and  glancing at haines <eos>
<sos> and stephen  crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and <eos>
<sos> lips and breastbone  <eos>
<sos>  seymour is back in town  the young man said  grasping again his spur of <eos>
<sos> rock  chucked medicine and going in for the army  <eos>
<sos>  ah  go to god  buck mulligan said  <eos>
<sos>  going over next week to stew  you know that red carlisle girl  lily  <eos>
<sos>  yes  <eos>
<sos>  spooning with him last night on the pier  the father is rotto with <eos>
<sos> money  <eos>
<sos>  is she up the pole  <eos>
<sos>  better ask seymour that  <eos>
<sos>  seymour a bleeding officer  buck mulligan said  <eos>
<sos> he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up  saying <eos>
<sos> tritely  <eos>
<sos>  redheaded women buck like goats  <eos>
<sos> he broke off in alarm  feeling his side under his flapping shirt  <eos>
<sos>  my twelfth rib is gone  he cried  i am the übermensch  toothless <eos>
<sos> kinch and i  the supermen  <eos>
<sos> he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his <eos>
<sos> clothes lay  <eos>
<sos>  are you going in here  malachi  <eos>
<sos>  yes  make room in the bed  <eos>
<sos> the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the <eos>
<sos> middle of the creek in two long clean strokes  haines sat down on a <eos>
<sos> stone  smoking  <eos>
<sos>  are you not coming in  buck mulligan asked  <eos>
<sos>  later on  haines said  not on my breakfast  <eos>
<sos> stephen turned away  <eos>
<sos>  i am going  mulligan  he said  <eos>
<sos>  give us that key  kinch  buck mulligan said  to keep my chemise flat  <eos>
<sos> stephen handed him the key  buck mulligan laid it across his heaped <eos>
<sos> clothes  <eos>
<sos>  and twopence  he said  for a pint  throw it there  <eos>
<sos> stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap  dressing  undressing  buck <eos>
<sos> mulligan erect  with joined hands before him  said solemnly  <eos>
<sos>  he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord  thus spake <eos>
<sos> zarathustra  <eos>
<sos> his plump body plunged  <eos>
<sos>  we ll see you again  haines said  turning as stephen walked up the <eos>
<sos> path and smiling at wild irish  <eos>
<sos> horn of a bull  hoof of a horse  smile of a saxon  <eos>
<sos>  the ship  buck mulligan cried  half twelve  <eos>
<sos>  good  stephen said  <eos>
<sos> he walked along the upwardcurving path  <eos>
<sos> liliata rutilantium  <eos>
<sos> turma circumdet  <eos>
<sos> iubilantium te virginum  <eos>
<sos> the priest is grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly  i will <eos>
<sos> not sleep here tonight  home also i cannot go  <eos>
<sos> a voice  sweettoned and sustained  called to him from the sea  turning <eos>
<sos> the curve he waved his hand  it called again  a sleek brown head  a <eos>
<sos> seal is  far out on the water  round  <eos>
<sos> usurper  <eos>
<sos>   2   <eos>
<sos>  you  cochrane  what city sent for him  <eos>
<sos>  tarentum  sir  <eos>
<sos>  very good  well  <eos>
<sos>  there was a battle  sir  <eos>
<sos>  very good  where  <eos>
<sos> the boy is blank face asked the blank window  <eos>
<sos> fabled by the daughters of memory  and yet it was in some way if not as <eos>
<sos> memory fabled it  a phrase  then  of impatience  thud of blake is wings <eos>
<sos> of excess  i hear the ruin of all space  shattered glass and toppling <eos>
<sos> masonry  and time one livid final flame  what is left us then  <eos>
<sos>  i forget the place  sir  279 b  c  <eos>
<sos>  asculum  stephen said  glancing at the name and date in the <eos>
<sos> gorescarred book  <eos>
<sos>  yes  sir  and he said  _another victory like that and we are done <eos>
<sos> for _ <eos>
<sos> that phrase the world had remembered  a dull ease of the mind  from a <eos>
<sos> hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers  <eos>
<sos> leaned upon his spear  any general to any officers  they lend ear  <eos>
<sos>  you  armstrong  stephen said  what was the end of pyrrhus  <eos>
<sos>  end of pyrrhus  sir  <eos>
<sos>  i know  sir  ask me  sir  comyn said  <eos>
<sos>  wait  you  armstrong  do you know anything about pyrrhus  <eos>
<sos> a bag of figrolls lay snugly in armstrong is satchel  he curled them <eos>
<sos> between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly  crumbs adhered <eos>
<sos> to the tissue of his lips  a sweetened boy is breath  welloff people  <eos>
<sos> proud that their eldest son was in the navy  vico road  dalkey  <eos>
<sos>  pyrrhus  sir  pyrrhus  a pier  <eos>
<sos> all laughed  mirthless high malicious laughter  armstrong looked round <eos>
<sos> at his classmates  silly glee in profile  in a moment they will laugh <eos>
<sos> more loudly  aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay  <eos>
<sos>  tell me now  stephen said  poking the boy is shoulder with the book  <eos>
<sos> what is a pier  <eos>
<sos>  a pier  sir  armstrong said  a thing out in the water  a kind of a <eos>
<sos> bridge  kingstown pier  sir  <eos>
<sos> some laughed again  mirthless but with meaning  two in the back bench <eos>
<sos> whispered  yes  they knew  had never learned nor ever been innocent  <eos>
<sos> all  with envy he watched their faces  edith  ethel  gerty  lily  their <eos>
<sos> likes  their breaths  too  sweetened with tea and jam  their bracelets <eos>
<sos> tittering in the struggle  <eos>
<sos>  kingstown pier  stephen said  yes  a disappointed bridge  <eos>
<sos> the words troubled their gaze  <eos>
<sos>  how  sir  comyn asked  a bridge is across a river  <eos>
<sos> for haines is chapbook  no one here to hear  tonight deftly amid wild <eos>
<sos> drink and talk  to pierce the polished mail of his mind  what then  a <eos>
<sos> jester at the court of his master  indulged and disesteemed  winning a <eos>
<sos> clement master is praise  why had they chosen all that part  not wholly <eos>
<sos> for the smooth caress  for them too history was a tale like any other <eos>
<sos> too often heard  their land a pawnshop  <eos>
<sos> had pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam is hand in argos or julius caesar not <eos>
<sos> been knifed to death  they are not to be thought away  time has branded <eos>
<sos> them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite <eos>
<sos> possibilities they have ousted  but can those have been possible seeing <eos>
<sos> that they never were  or was that only possible which came to pass  <eos>
<sos> weave  weaver of the wind  <eos>
<sos>  tell us a story  sir  <eos>
<sos>  o  do  sir  a ghoststory  <eos>
<sos>  where do you begin in this  stephen asked  opening another book  <eos>
<sos>  weep no more  comyn said  <eos>
<sos>  go on then  talbot  <eos>
<sos>  and the story  sir  <eos>
<sos>  after  stephen said  go on  talbot  <eos>
<sos> a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork <eos>
<sos> of his satchel  he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text  <eos>
<sos> _ weep no more  woful shepherds  weep no more <eos>
<sos> for lycidas  your sorrow  is not dead  <eos>
<sos> sunk though he be beneath the watery floor   _ <eos>
<sos> it must be a movement then  an actuality of the possible as possible  <eos>
<sos> aristotle is phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated <eos>
<sos> out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where <eos>
<sos> he had read  sheltered from the sin of paris  night by night  by his <eos>
<sos> elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy  fed and feeding <eos>
<sos> brains about me  under glowlamps  impaled  with faintly beating <eos>
<sos> feelers  and in my mind is darkness a sloth of the underworld  <eos>
<sos> reluctant  shy of brightness  shifting her dragon scaly folds  thought <eos>
<sos> is the thought of thought  tranquil brightness  the soul is in a manner <eos>
<sos> all that is  the soul is the form of forms  tranquility sudden  vast  <eos>
<sos> candescent  form of forms  <eos>
<sos> talbot repeated  <eos>
<sos> _ through the dear might of him that walked the waves  <eos>
<sos> through the dear might   _ <eos>
<sos>  turn over  stephen said quietly  i do not see anything  <eos>
<sos>  what  sir  talbot asked simply  bending forward  <eos>
<sos> his hand turned the page over  he leaned back and went on again  having <eos>
<sos> just remembered  of him that walked the waves  here also over these <eos>
<sos> craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer is heart and lips and <eos>
<sos> on mine  it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the <eos>
<sos> tribute  to caesar what is caesar is  to god what is god is  a long look <eos>
<sos> from dark eyes  a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the <eos>
<sos> church is looms  ay  <eos>
<sos> riddle me  riddle me  randy ro  <eos>
<sos> my father gave me seeds to sow  <eos>
<sos> talbot slid his closed book into his satchel  <eos>
<sos>  have i heard all  stephen asked  <eos>
<sos>  yes  sir  hockey at ten  sir  <eos>
<sos>  half day  sir  thursday  <eos>
<sos>  who can answer a riddle  stephen asked  <eos>
<sos> they bundled their books away  pencils clacking  pages rustling  <eos>
<sos> crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels  all <eos>
<sos> gabbling gaily  <eos>
<sos>  a riddle  sir  ask me  sir  <eos>
<sos>  o  ask me  sir  <eos>
<sos>  a hard one  sir  <eos>
<sos>  this is the riddle  stephen said  <eos>
<sos> the cock crew  <eos>
<sos> the sky was blue  <eos>
<sos> the bells in heaven <eos>
<sos> were striking eleven  <eos>
<sos>  tis time for this poor soul <eos>
<sos> to go to heaven  <eos>
<sos> what is that  <eos>
<sos>  what  sir  <eos>
<sos>  again  sir  we did not hear  <eos>
<sos> their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated  after a silence <eos>
<sos> cochrane said  <eos>
<sos>  what is it  sir  we give it up  <eos>
<sos> stephen  his throat itching  answered  <eos>
<sos>  the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush  <eos>
<sos> he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries <eos>
<sos> echoed dismay  <eos>
<sos> a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called  <eos>
<sos>  hockey  <eos>
<sos> they broke asunder  sidling out of their benches  leaping them  quickly <eos>
<sos> they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and <eos>
<sos> clamour of their boots and tongues  <eos>
<sos> sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly  showing an open <eos>
<sos> copybook  his tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness <eos>
<sos> and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading  on his <eos>
<sos> cheek  dull and bloodless  a soft stain of ink lay  dateshaped  recent <eos>
<sos> and damp as a snail is bed  <eos>
<sos> he held out his copybook  the word sums was written on the headline  <eos>
<sos> beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with <eos>
<sos> blind loops and a blot  cyril sargent  his name and seal  <eos>
<sos>  mr deasy told me to write them out all again  he said  and show them <eos>
<sos> to you  sir  <eos>
<sos> stephen touched the edges of the book  futility  <eos>
<sos>  do you understand how to do them now  he asked  <eos>
<sos>  numbers eleven to fifteen  sargent answered  mr deasy said i was to <eos>
<sos> copy them off the board  sir  <eos>
<sos>  can you do them yourself  stephen asked  <eos>
<sos>  no  sir  <eos>
<sos> ugly and futile  lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink  a <eos>
<sos> snail is bed  yet someone had loved him  borne him in her arms and in <eos>
<sos> her heart  but for her the race of the world would have trampled him <eos>
<sos> underfoot  a squashed boneless snail  she had loved his weak watery <eos>
<sos> blood drained from her own  was that then real  the only true thing in <eos>
<sos> life  his mother is prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal <eos>
<sos> bestrode  she was no more  the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in <eos>
<sos> the fire  an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes  she had saved him from <eos>
<sos> being trampled underfoot and had gone  scarcely having been  a poor <eos>
<sos> soul gone to heaven  and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox  red <eos>
<sos> reek of rapine in his fur  with merciless bright eyes scraped in the <eos>
<sos> earth  listened  scraped up the earth  listened  scraped and scraped  <eos>
<sos> sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem  he proves by <eos>
<sos> algebra that shakespeare is ghost is hamlet is grandfather  sargent <eos>
<sos> peered askance through his slanted glasses  hockeysticks rattled in the <eos>
<sos> lumberroom  the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field  <eos>
<sos> across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice  in the mummery of <eos>
<sos> their letters  wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes  give hands  <eos>
<sos> traverse  bow to partner  so  imps of fancy of the moors  gone too from <eos>
<sos> the world  averroes and moses maimonides  dark men in mien and <eos>
<sos> movement  flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the <eos>
<sos> world  a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not <eos>
<sos> comprehend  <eos>
<sos>  do you understand now  can you work the second for yourself  <eos>
<sos>  yes  sir  <eos>
<sos> in long shaky strokes sargent copied the data  waiting always for a <eos>
<sos> word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols  a faint <eos>
<sos> hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin  amor matris  subjective <eos>
<sos> and objective genitive  with her weak blood and wheysour milk she had <eos>
<sos> fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands  <eos>
<sos> like him was i  these sloping shoulders  this gracelessness  my <eos>
<sos> childhood bends beside me  too far for me to lay a hand there once or <eos>
<sos> lightly  mine is far and his secret as our eyes  secrets  silent  stony <eos>
<sos> sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts  secrets weary of their <eos>
<sos> tyranny  tyrants  willing to be dethroned  <eos>
<sos> the sum was done  <eos>
<sos>  it is very simple  stephen said as he stood up  <eos>
<sos>  yes  sir  thanks  sargent answered  <eos>
<sos> he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his <eos>
<sos> copybook back to his bench  <eos>
<sos>  you had better get your stick and go out to the others  stephen said <eos>
<sos> as he followed towards the door the boy is graceless form  <eos>
<sos>  yes  sir  <eos>
<sos> in the corridor his name was heard  called from the playfield  <eos>
<sos>  sargent  <eos>
<sos>  run on  stephen said  mr deasy is calling you  <eos>
<sos> he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy <eos>
<sos> field where sharp voices were in strife  they were sorted in teams and <eos>
<sos> mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet  <eos>
<sos> when he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to <eos>
<sos> him  he turned his angry white moustache  <eos>
<sos>  what is it now  he cried continually without listening  <eos>
<sos>  cochrane and halliday are on the same side  sir  stephen said  <eos>
<sos>  will you wait in my study for a moment  mr deasy said  till i restore <eos>
<sos> order here  <eos>
<sos> and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man is voice <eos>
<sos> cried sternly  <eos>
<sos>  what is the matter  what is it now  <eos>
<sos> their sharp voices cried about him on all sides  their many forms <eos>
<sos> closed round him  the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his <eos>
<sos> illdyed head  <eos>
<sos> stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded <eos>
<sos> leather of its chairs  as on the first day he bargained with me here  <eos>
<sos> as it was in the beginning  is now  on the sideboard the tray of stuart <eos>
<sos> coins  base treasure of a bog  and ever shall be  and snug in their <eos>
<sos> spooncase of purple plush  faded  the twelve apostles having preached <eos>
<sos> to all the gentiles  world without end  <eos>
<sos> a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor  blowing out his <eos>
<sos> rare moustache mr deasy halted at the table  <eos>
<sos>  first  our little financial settlement  he said  <eos>
<sos> he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong  it <eos>
<sos> slapped open and he took from it two notes  one of joined halves  and <eos>
<sos> laid them carefully on the table  <eos>
<sos>  two  he said  strapping and stowing his pocketbook away  <eos>
<sos> and now his strongroom for the gold  stephen is embarrassed hand moved <eos>
<sos> over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar  whelks and money <eos>
<sos> cowries and leopard shells  and this  whorled as an emir is turban  and <eos>
<sos> this  the scallop of saint james  an old pilgrim is hoard  dead <eos>
<sos> treasure  hollow shells  <eos>
<sos> a sovereign fell  bright and new  on the soft pile of the tablecloth  <eos>
<sos>  three  mr deasy said  turning his little savingsbox about in his hand  <eos>
<sos> these are handy things to have  see  this is for sovereigns  this is <eos>
<sos> for shillings  sixpences  halfcrowns  and here crowns  see  <eos>
<sos> he shot from it two crowns and two shillings  <eos>
<sos>  three twelve  he said  i think you ll find that is right  <eos>
<sos>  thank you  sir  stephen said  gathering the money together with shy <eos>
<sos> haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers  <eos>
<sos>  no thanks at all  mr deasy said  you have earned it  <eos>
<sos> stephen is hand  free again  went back to the hollow shells  symbols too <eos>
<sos> of beauty and of power  a lump in my pocket  symbols soiled by greed <eos>
<sos> and misery  <eos>
<sos>  do not carry it like that  mr deasy said  you ll pull it out somewhere <eos>
<sos> and lose it  you just buy one of these machines  you ll find them very <eos>
<sos> handy  <eos>
<sos> answer something  <eos>
<sos>  mine would be often empty  stephen said  <eos>
<sos> the same room and hour  the same wisdom  and i the same  three times <eos>
<sos> now  three nooses round me here  well  i can break them in this instant <eos>
<sos> if i will  <eos>
<sos>  because you do not save  mr deasy said  pointing his finger  you do not <eos>
<sos> know yet what money is  money is power  when you have lived as long as <eos>
<sos> i have  i know  i know  if youth but knew  but what does shakespeare <eos>
<sos> say  put but money in thy purse  <eos>
<sos>  iago  stephen murmured  <eos>
<sos> he lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man is stare  <eos>
<sos>  he knew what money was  mr deasy said  he made money  a poet  yes  but <eos>
<sos> an englishman too  do you know what is the pride of the english  do you <eos>
<sos> know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an englishman is <eos>
<sos> mouth  <eos>
<sos> the seas  ruler  his seacold eyes looked on the empty bay  it seems <eos>
<sos> history is to blame  on me and on my words  unhating  <eos>
<sos>  that on his empire  stephen said  the sun never sets  <eos>
<sos>  ba  mr deasy cried  that is not english  a french celt said that  he <eos>
<sos> tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail  <eos>
<sos>  i will tell you  he said solemnly  what is his proudest boast  _i paid <eos>
<sos> my way _ <eos>
<sos> good man  good man  <eos>
<sos>  i paid my way  i never borrowed a shilling in my life  can you feel <eos>
<sos> that  i owe nothing  can you  <eos>
<sos> mulligan  nine pounds  three pairs of socks  one pair brogues  ties  <eos>
<sos> curran  ten guineas  mccann  one guinea  fred ryan  two shillings  <eos>
<sos> temple  two lunches  russell  one guinea  cousins  ten shillings  bob <eos>
<sos> reynolds  half a guinea  koehler  three guineas  mrs mackernan  five <eos>
<sos> weeks  board  the lump i have is useless  <eos>
<sos>  for the moment  no  stephen answered  <eos>
<sos> mr deasy laughed with rich delight  putting back his savingsbox  <eos>
<sos>  i knew you could not  he said joyously  but one day you must feel it  <eos>
<sos> we are a generous people but we must also be just  <eos>
<sos>  i fear those big words  stephen said  which make us so unhappy  <eos>
<sos> mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the <eos>
<sos> shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs  albert edward  prince of <eos>
<sos> wales  <eos>
<sos>  you think me an old fogey and an old tory  his thoughtful voice said  <eos>
<sos> i saw three generations since o connell is time  i remember the famine <eos>
<sos> in  46  do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the <eos>
<sos> union twenty years before o connell did or before the prelates of your <eos>
<sos> communion denounced him as a demagogue  you fenians forget some things  <eos>
<sos> glorious  pious and immortal memory  the lodge of diamond in armagh the <eos>
<sos> splendid behung with corpses of papishes  hoarse  masked and armed  the <eos>
<sos> planters  covenant  the black north and true blue bible  croppies lie <eos>
<sos> down  <eos>
<sos> stephen sketched a brief gesture  <eos>
<sos>  i have rebel blood in me too  mr deasy said  on the spindle side  but <eos>
<sos> i am descended from sir john blackwood who voted for the union  we are <eos>
<sos> all irish  all kings  sons  <eos>
<sos>  alas  stephen said  <eos>
<sos>  per vias rectas  mr deasy said firmly  was his motto  he voted for <eos>
<sos> it and put on his topboots to ride to dublin from the ards of down to <eos>
<sos> do so  <eos>
<sos> lal the ral the ra <eos>
<sos> the rocky road to dublin  <eos>
<sos> a gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots  soft day  sir john  <eos>
<sos> soft day  your honour     day     day     two topboots jog dangling on <eos>
<sos> to dublin  lal the ral the ra  lal the ral the raddy  <eos>
<sos>  that reminds me  mr deasy said  you can do me a favour  mr dedalus  <eos>
<sos> with some of your literary friends  i have a letter here for the press  <eos>
<sos> sit down a moment  i have just to copy the end  <eos>
<sos> he went to the desk near the window  pulled in his chair twice and read <eos>
<sos> off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter  <eos>
<sos>  sit down  excuse me  he said over his shoulder  _the dictates of <eos>
<sos> common sense _ just a moment  <eos>
<sos> he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow <eos>
<sos> and  muttering  began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly  <eos>
<sos> sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error  <eos>
<sos> stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence  framed <eos>
<sos> around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage  their meek <eos>
<sos> heads poised in air  lord hastings  repulse  the duke of <eos>
<sos> westminster is shotover  the duke of beaufort is ceylon  _prix de <eos>
<sos> paris_  1866  elfin riders sat them  watchful of a sign  he saw their <eos>
<sos> speeds  backing king is colours  and shouted with the shouts of vanished <eos>
<sos> crowds  <eos>
<sos>  full stop  mr deasy bade his keys  _but prompt ventilation of this <eos>
<sos> allimportant question   _ <eos>
<sos> where cranly led me to get rich quick  hunting his winners among the <eos>
<sos> mudsplashed brakes  amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek <eos>
<sos> of the canteen  over the motley slush  even money fair rebel  ten to <eos>
<sos> one the field  dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs  <eos>
<sos> the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman  a butcher is <eos>
<sos> dame  nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange  <eos>
<sos> shouts rang shrill from the boys  playfield and a whirring whistle  <eos>
<sos> again  a goal  i am among them  among their battling bodies in a <eos>
<sos> medley  the joust of life  you mean that knockkneed mother is darling <eos>
<sos> who seems to be slightly crawsick  jousts  time shocked rebounds  shock <eos>
<sos> by shock  jousts  slush and uproar of battles  the frozen deathspew of <eos>
<sos> the slain  a shout of spearspikes baited with men is bloodied guts  <eos>
<sos>  now then  mr deasy said  rising  <eos>
<sos> he came to the table  pinning together his sheets  stephen stood up  <eos>
<sos>  i have put the matter into a nutshell  mr deasy said  it is about the <eos>
<sos> foot and mouth disease  just look through it  there can be no two <eos>
<sos> opinions on the matter  <eos>
<sos> may i trespass on your valuable space  that doctrine of laissez faire <eos>
<sos> which so often in our history  our cattle trade  the way of all our old <eos>
<sos> industries  liverpool ring which jockeyed the galway harbour scheme  <eos>
<sos> european conflagration  grain supplies through the narrow waters of the <eos>
<sos> channel  the pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of <eos>
<sos> agriculture  pardoned a classical allusion  cassandra  by a woman who <eos>
<sos> was no better than she should be  to come to the point at issue  <eos>
<sos>  i do not mince words  do i  mr deasy asked as stephen read on  <eos>
<sos> foot and mouth disease  known as koch is preparation  serum and virus  <eos>
<sos> percentage of salted horses  rinderpest  emperor is horses at mürzsteg  <eos>
<sos> lower austria  veterinary surgeons  mr henry blackwood price  courteous <eos>
<sos> offer a fair trial  dictates of common sense  allimportant question  in <eos>
<sos> every sense of the word take the bull by the horns  thanking you for <eos>
<sos> the hospitality of your columns  <eos>
<sos>  i want that to be printed and read  mr deasy said  you will see at the <eos>
<sos> next outbreak they will put an embargo on irish cattle  and it can be <eos>
<sos> cured  it is cured  my cousin  blackwood price  writes to me it is <eos>
<sos> regularly treated and cured in austria by cattledoctors there  they <eos>
<sos> offer to come over here  i am trying to work up influence with the <eos>
<sos> department  now i am going to try publicity  i am surrounded by <eos>
<sos> difficulties  by    intrigues by    backstairs influence by    <eos>
<sos> he raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke  <eos>
<sos>  mark my words  mr dedalus  he said  england is in the hands of the <eos>
<sos> jews  in all the highest places  her finance  her press  and they are <eos>
<sos> the signs of a nation is decay  wherever they gather they eat up the <eos>
<sos> nation is vital strength  i have seen it coming these years  as sure as <eos>
<sos> we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of <eos>
<sos> destruction  old england is dying  <eos>
<sos> he stepped swiftly off  his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a <eos>
<sos> broad sunbeam  he faced about and back again  <eos>
<sos>  dying  he said again  if not dead by now  <eos>
<sos> the harlot is cry from street to street <eos>
<sos> shall weave old england is windingsheet  <eos>
<sos> his eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which <eos>
<sos> he halted  <eos>
<sos>  a merchant  stephen said  is one who buys cheap and sells dear  jew or <eos>
<sos> gentile  is he not  <eos>
<sos>  they sinned against the light  mr deasy said gravely  and you can see <eos>
<sos> the darkness in their eyes  and that is why they are wanderers on the <eos>
<sos> earth to this day  <eos>
<sos> on the steps of the paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting <eos>
<sos> prices on their gemmed fingers  gabble of geese  they swarmed loud  <eos>
<sos> uncouth about the temple  their heads thickplotting under maladroit <eos>
<sos> silk hats  not theirs  these clothes  this speech  these gestures  <eos>
<sos> their full slow eyes belied the words  the gestures eager and <eos>
<sos> unoffending  but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their <eos>
<sos> zeal was vain  vain patience to heap and hoard  time surely would <eos>
<sos> scatter all  a hoard heaped by the roadside  plundered and passing on  <eos>
<sos> their eyes knew their years of wandering and  patient  knew the <eos>
<sos> dishonours of their flesh  <eos>
<sos>  who has not  stephen said  <eos>
<sos>  what do you mean  mr deasy asked  <eos>
<sos> he came forward a pace and stood by the table  his underjaw fell <eos>
<sos> sideways open uncertainly  is this old wisdom  he waits to hear from <eos>
<sos> me  <eos>
<sos>  history  stephen said  is a nightmare from which i am trying to awake  <eos>
<sos> from the playfield the boys raised a shout  a whirring whistle  goal  <eos>
<sos> what if that nightmare gave you a back kick  <eos>
<sos>  the ways of the creator are not our ways  mr deasy said  all human <eos>
<sos> history moves towards one great goal  the manifestation of god  <eos>
<sos> stephen jerked his thumb towards the window  saying  <eos>
<sos>  that is god  <eos>
<sos> hooray  ay  whrrwhee  <eos>
<sos>  what  mr deasy asked  <eos>
<sos>  a shout in the street  stephen answered  shrugging his shoulders  <eos>
<sos> mr deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked <eos>
<sos> between his fingers  looking up again he set them free  <eos>
<sos>  i am happier than you are  he said  we have committed many errors and <eos>
<sos> many sins  a woman brought sin into the world  for a woman who was no <eos>
<sos> better than she should be  helen  the runaway wife of menelaus  ten <eos>
<sos> years the greeks made war on troy  a faithless wife first brought the <eos>
<sos> strangers to our shore here  macmurrough is wife and her leman  <eos>
<sos> o rourke  prince of breffni  a woman too brought parnell low  many <eos>
<sos> errors  many failures but not the one sin  i am a struggler now at the <eos>
<sos> end of my days  but i will fight for the right till the end  <eos>
<sos> for ulster will fight <eos>
<sos> and ulster will be right  <eos>
<sos> stephen raised the sheets in his hand  <eos>
<sos>  well  sir  he began  <eos>
<sos>  i foresee  mr deasy said  that you will not remain here very long at <eos>
<sos> this work  you were not born to be a teacher  i think  perhaps i am <eos>
<sos> wrong  <eos>
<sos>  a learner rather  stephen said  <eos>
<sos> and here what will you learn more  <eos>
<sos> mr deasy shook his head  <eos>
<sos>  who knows  he said  to learn one must be humble  but life is the great <eos>
<sos> teacher  <eos>
<sos> stephen rustled the sheets again  <eos>
<sos>  as regards these  he began  <eos>
<sos>  yes  mr deasy said  you have two copies there  if you can have them <eos>
<sos> published at once  <eos>
<sos> telegraph  irish homestead  <eos>
<sos>  i will try  stephen said  and let you know tomorrow  i know two <eos>
<sos> editors slightly  <eos>
<sos>  that will do  mr deasy said briskly  i wrote last night to mr field  <eos>
<sos> m p  there is a meeting of the cattletraders  association today at the <eos>
<sos> city arms hotel  i asked him to lay my letter before the meeting  you <eos>
<sos> see if you can get it into your two papers  what are they  <eos>
<sos>  the evening telegraph    <eos>
<sos>  that will do  mr deasy said  there is no time to lose  now i have to <eos>
<sos> answer that letter from my cousin  <eos>
<sos>  good morning  sir  stephen said  putting the sheets in his pocket  <eos>
<sos> thank you  <eos>
<sos>  not at all  mr deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk  i <eos>
<sos> like to break a lance with you  old as i am  <eos>
<sos>  good morning  sir  stephen said again  bowing to his bent back  <eos>
<sos> he went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees  <eos>
<sos> hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield  the <eos>
<sos> lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate  <eos>
<sos> toothless terrors  still i will help him in his fight  mulligan will <eos>
<sos> dub me a new name  the bullockbefriending bard  <eos>
<sos>  mr dedalus  <eos>
<sos> running after me  no more letters  i hope  <eos>
<sos>  just one moment  <eos>

<sos> he laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock  <eos>
<sos> carefully  for the rest let look who will  <eos>

<sos> he turned his face over a shoulder  rere regardant  moving through the <eos>

<sos> mr leopold bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls  <eos>
<sos> he liked thick giblet soup  nutty gizzards  a stuffed roast heart  <eos>
<sos> liverslices fried with crustcrumbs  fried hencods  roes  most of all he <eos>
<sos> liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of <eos>
<sos> faintly scented urine  <eos>
<sos> kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly  righting <eos>
<sos> her breakfast things on the humpy tray  gelid light and air were in the <eos>
<sos> kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere  made him <eos>
<sos> feel a bit peckish  <eos>
<sos> the coals were reddening  <eos>
<sos> another slice of bread and butter  three  four  right  she did not like <eos>
<sos> her plate full  right  he turned from the tray  lifted the kettle off <eos>
<sos> the hob and set it sideways on the fire  it sat there  dull and squat  <eos>
<sos> its spout stuck out  cup of tea soon  good  mouth dry  the cat walked <eos>
<sos> stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high  <eos>
<sos>  mkgnao  <eos>
<sos>  o  there you are  mr bloom said  turning from the fire  <eos>
<sos> the cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the <eos>
<sos> table  mewing  just how she stalks over my writingtable  prr  scratch <eos>
<sos> my head  prr  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom watched curiously  kindly the lithe black form  clean to see  <eos>
<sos> the gloss of her sleek hide  the white button under the butt of her <eos>
<sos> tail  the green flashing eyes  he bent down to her  his hands on his <eos>
<sos> knees  <eos>
<sos>  milk for the pussens  he said  <eos>
<sos>  mrkgnao  the cat cried  <eos>
<sos> they call them stupid  they understand what we say better than we <eos>
<sos> understand them  she understands all she wants to  vindictive too  <eos>
<sos> cruel  her nature  curious mice never squeal  seem to like it  wonder <eos>
<sos> what i look like to her  height of a tower  no  she can jump me  <eos>
<sos>  afraid of the chickens she is  he said mockingly  afraid of the <eos>
<sos> chookchooks  i never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens  <eos>
<sos>  mrkrgnao  the cat said loudly  <eos>
<sos> she blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes  mewing plaintively <eos>
<sos> and long  showing him her milkwhite teeth  he watched the dark eyeslits <eos>
<sos> narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones  then he went to <eos>
<sos> the dresser  took the jug hanlon is milkman had just filled for him  <eos>
<sos> poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor  <eos>
<sos>  gurrhr  she cried  running to lap  <eos>
<sos> he watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped <eos>
<sos> three times and licked lightly  wonder is it true if you clip them they <eos>
<sos> ca not mouse after  why  they shine in the dark  perhaps  the tips  or <eos>
<sos> kind of feelers in the dark  perhaps  <eos>
<sos> he listened to her licking lap  ham and eggs  no  no good eggs with <eos>
<sos> this drouth  want pure fresh water  thursday  not a good day either for <eos>
<sos> a mutton kidney at buckley is  fried with butter  a shake of pepper  <eos>
<sos> better a pork kidney at dlugacz is  while the kettle is boiling  she <eos>
<sos> lapped slower  then licking the saucer clean  why are their tongues so <eos>
<sos> rough  to lap better  all porous holes  nothing she can eat  he glanced <eos>
<sos> round him  no  <eos>
<sos> on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall  paused by <eos>
<sos> the bedroom door  she might like something tasty  thin bread and butter <eos>
<sos> she likes in the morning  still perhaps  once in a way  <eos>
<sos> he said softly in the bare hall  <eos>
<sos>  i am going round the corner  be back in a minute  <eos>
<sos> and when he had heard his voice say it he added  <eos>
<sos>  you do not want anything for breakfast  <eos>
<sos> a sleepy soft grunt answered  <eos>
<sos>  mn  <eos>
<sos> no  she did not want anything  he heard then a warm heavy sigh  softer  <eos>
<sos> as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled  <eos>
<sos> must get those settled really  pity  all the way from gibraltar  <eos>
<sos> forgotten any little spanish she knew  wonder what her father gave for <eos>
<sos> it  old style  ah yes  of course  bought it at the governor is auction  <eos>

<sos> plevna that was  i rose from the ranks  sir  and i am proud of it  still <eos>
<sos> he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps  now that was <eos>
<sos> farseeing  <eos>
<sos> his hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat <eos>
<sos> and his lost property office secondhand waterproof  stamps  stickyback <eos>
<sos> pictures  daresay lots of officers are in the swim too  course they do  <eos>
<sos> the sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely  plasto is <eos>
<sos> high grade ha  he peeped quickly inside the leather headband  white <eos>
<sos> slip of paper  quite safe  <eos>
<sos> on the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey  not there  <eos>
<sos> in the trousers i left off  must get it  potato i have  creaky <eos>
<sos> wardrobe  no use disturbing her  she turned over sleepily that time  he <eos>
<sos> pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly  more  till the footleaf <eos>
<sos> dropped gently over the threshold  a limp lid  looked shut  all right <eos>
<sos> till i come back anyhow  <eos>
<sos> he crossed to the bright side  avoiding the loose cellarflap of number <eos>
<sos> seventyfive  the sun was nearing the steeple of george is church  be a <eos>
<sos> warm day i fancy  specially in these black clothes feel it more  black <eos>
<sos> conducts  reflects   refracts is it    the heat  but i could not go in <eos>
<sos> that light suit  make a picnic of it  his eyelids sank quietly often as <eos>
<sos> he walked in happy warmth  boland is breadvan delivering with trays our <eos>
<sos> daily but she prefers yesterday is loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot  <eos>
<sos> makes you feel young  somewhere in the east  early morning  set off at <eos>

<sos> carpet shops  big man  turko the terrible  seated crosslegged  smoking <eos>
<sos> a coiled pipe  cries of sellers in the streets  drink water scented <eos>
<sos> with fennel  sherbet  dander along all day  might meet a robber or two  <eos>
<sos> well  meet him  getting on to sundown  the shadows of the mosques among <eos>

<sos> those instruments what do you call them  dulcimers  i pass  <eos>
<sos> probably not a bit like it really  kind of stuff you read  in the track <eos>
<sos> of the sun  sunburst on the titlepage  he smiled  pleasing himself  <eos>
<sos> what arthur griffith said about the headpiece over the freeman <eos>
<sos> leader  a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway <eos>
<sos> behind the bank of ireland  he prolonged his pleased smile  ikey touch <eos>

<sos> he halted before dlugacz is window  staring at the hanks of sausages  <eos>
<sos> polonies  black and white  fifteen multiplied by  the figures whitened <eos>
<sos> in his mind  unsolved  displeased  he let them fade  the shiny links  <eos>
<sos> packed with forcemeat  fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the <eos>
<sos> lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs  blood  <eos>
<sos> a kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish  the last  he <eos>
<sos> stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter  would she buy it too  <eos>
<sos> calling the items from a slip in her hand  chapped  washingsoda  and a <eos>
<sos> pound and a half of denny is sausages  his eyes rested on her vigorous <eos>

<sos> the clothesline  she does whack it  by george  the way her crooked <eos>

<sos> the ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with <eos>
<sos> blotchy fingers  sausagepink  sound meat there  like a stallfed heifer  <eos>
<sos> he took a page up from the pile of cut sheets  the model farm at <eos>

<sos> beasts lowing in their pens  branded sheep  flop and fall of dung  the <eos>
<sos> breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter  slapping a <eos>
<sos> palm on a ripemeated hindquarter  there is a prime one  unpeeled <eos>
<sos> switches in their hands  he held the page aslant patiently  bending his <eos>
<sos> senses and his will  his soft subject gaze at rest  the crooked skirt <eos>
<sos> swinging  whack by whack by whack  <eos>
<sos> the porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile  wrapped up her prime <eos>
<sos> sausages and made a red grimace  <eos>
<sos>  now  my miss  he said  <eos>
<sos> she tendered a coin  smiling boldly  holding her thick wrist out  <eos>
<sos>  thank you  my miss  and one shilling threepence change  for you  <eos>

<sos> mr bloom pointed quickly  to catch up and walk behind her if she went <eos>
<sos> slowly  behind her moving hams  pleasant to see first thing in the <eos>
<sos> morning  hurry up  damn it  make hay while the sun shines  she stood <eos>
<sos> outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right  he <eos>
<sos> sighed down his nose  they never understand  sodachapped hands  crusted <eos>
<sos> toenails too  brown scapulars in tatters  defending her both ways  the <eos>

<sos> then it fetched up three coins from his trousers  pocket and laid them <eos>
<sos> on the rubber prickles  they lay  were read quickly and quickly slid  <eos>
<sos> disc by disc  into the till  <eos>

<sos>  a letter for me from milly  he said carefully  and a card to you  and <eos>

<sos> he laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of <eos>
<sos> her knees  <eos>
<sos>  do you want the blind up  <eos>
<sos> letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her <eos>
<sos> glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow  <eos>
<sos>  that do  he asked  turning  <eos>
<sos> she was reading the card  propped on her elbow  <eos>
<sos>  she got the things  she said  <eos>
<sos> he waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back <eos>
<sos> slowly with a snug sigh  <eos>
<sos>  hurry up with that tea  she said  i am parched  <eos>
<sos>  the kettle is boiling  he said  <eos>
<sos> but he delayed to clear the chair  her striped petticoat  tossed soiled <eos>
<sos> linen  and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed  <eos>
<sos> as he went down the kitchen stairs she called  <eos>
<sos>  poldy  <eos>
<sos>  what  <eos>
<sos>  scald the teapot  <eos>
<sos> on the boil sure enough  a plume of steam from the spout  he scalded <eos>
<sos> and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea  tilting <eos>
<sos> the kettle then to let the water flow in  having set it to draw he took <eos>
<sos> off the kettle  crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the <eos>
<sos> lump of butter slide and melt  while he unwrapped the kidney the cat <eos>
<sos> mewed hungrily against him  give her too much meat she wo not mouse  say <eos>
<sos> they wo not eat pork  kosher  here  he let the bloodsmeared paper fall <eos>
<sos> to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce  pepper  <eos>
<sos> he sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup  <eos>
<sos> then he slit open his letter  glancing down the page and over  thanks  <eos>

<sos> bread and butter  four  sugar  spoon  her cream  yes  he carried it <eos>
<sos> upstairs  his thumb hooked in the teapot handle  <eos>
<sos> nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it <eos>
<sos> on the chair by the bedhead  <eos>
<sos>  what a time you were  she said  <eos>
<sos> she set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly  an elbow on <eos>
<sos> the pillow  he looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large <eos>
<sos> soft bubs  sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat is udder  the <eos>
<sos> warmth of her couched body rose on the air  mingling with the fragrance <eos>
<sos> of the tea she poured  <eos>
<sos> a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow  in the <eos>
<sos> act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread  <eos>
<sos>  who was the letter from  he asked  <eos>
<sos> bold hand  marion  <eos>
<sos>  o  boylan  she said  he is bringing the programme  <eos>

<sos> she doubled a slice of bread into her mouth  asking  <eos>
<sos>  what time is the funeral  <eos>
<sos>  eleven  i think  he answered  i did not see the paper  <eos>
<sos> following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled <eos>
<sos> drawers from the bed  no  then  a twisted grey garter looped round a <eos>
<sos> stocking  rumpled  shiny sole  <eos>
<sos>  no  that book  <eos>
<sos> other stocking  her petticoat  <eos>

<sos> that right  voglio  not in the bed  must have slid down  he stooped <eos>
<sos> and lifted the valance  the book  fallen  sprawled against the bulge of <eos>
<sos> the orangekeyed chamberpot  <eos>
<sos>  show here  she said  i put a mark in it  there is a word i wanted to <eos>
<sos> ask you  <eos>
<sos> she swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and  <eos>
<sos> having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket  began to search the <eos>
<sos> text with the hairpin till she reached the word  <eos>
<sos>  met him what  he asked  <eos>
<sos>  here  she said  what does that mean  <eos>
<sos> he leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail  <eos>
<sos>  metempsychosis  <eos>
<sos>  yes  who is he when he is at home  <eos>
<sos>  metempsychosis  he said  frowning  it is greek  from the greek  that <eos>
<sos> means the transmigration of souls  <eos>
<sos>  o  rocks  she said  tell us in plain words  <eos>
<sos> he smiled  glancing askance at her mocking eyes  the same young eyes  <eos>
<sos> the first night after the charades  dolphin is barn  he turned over the <eos>
<sos> smudged pages  ruby  the pride of the ring  hello  illustration  <eos>
<sos> fierce italian with carriagewhip  must be ruby pride of the on the <eos>

<sos> must get that capel street library book renewed or they ll write to <eos>
<sos> kearney  my guarantor  reincarnation  that is the word  <eos>
<sos>  some people believe  he said  that we go on living in another body <eos>
<sos> after death  that we lived before  they call it reincarnation  that we <eos>
<sos> all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other <eos>
<sos> planet  they say we have forgotten it  some say they remember their <eos>
<sos> past lives  <eos>
<sos> the sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea  better <eos>
<sos> remind her of the word  metempsychosis  an example would be better  an <eos>
<sos> example  <eos>

<sos> used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree  for <eos>
<sos> instance  what they called nymphs  for example  <eos>
<sos> her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar  she gazed straight before her  <eos>
<sos> inhaling through her arched nostrils  <eos>
<sos>  there is a smell of burn  she said  did you leave anything on the fire  <eos>
<sos>  the kidney  he cried suddenly  <eos>
<sos> he fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and  stubbing his toes <eos>
<sos> against the broken commode  hurried out towards the smell  stepping <eos>
<sos> hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork is legs  pungent smoke <eos>
<sos> shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan  by prodding a prong of <eos>
<sos> the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its <eos>
<sos> back  only a little burnt  he tossed it off the pan on to a plate and <eos>
<sos> let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it  <eos>
<sos> cup of tea now  he sat down  cut and buttered a slice of the loaf  he <eos>
<sos> shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat  then he put a <eos>
<sos> forkful into his mouth  chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant <eos>
<sos> meat  done to a turn  a mouthful of tea  then he cut away dies of <eos>
<sos> bread  sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth  what was that <eos>
<sos> about some young student and a picnic  he creased out the letter at his <eos>
<sos> side  reading it slowly as he chewed  sopping another die of bread in <eos>
<sos> the gravy and raising it to his mouth  <eos>

<sos> finest quality  family tea  rather warm  tea  must get some from tom <eos>
<sos> kernan  could not ask him at a funeral  though  while his eyes still <eos>
<sos> read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent <eos>
<sos> his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair  very warm <eos>
<sos> morning  under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the <eos>
<sos> leather headband inside his high grade ha  just there  his right hand <eos>
<sos> came down into the bowl of his hat  his fingers found quickly a card <eos>
<sos> behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket  <eos>
<sos> so warm  his right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and <eos>
<sos> hair  then he put on his hat again  relieved  and read again  choice <eos>
<sos> blend  made of the finest ceylon brands  the far east  lovely spot it <eos>
<sos> must be  the garden of the world  big lazy leaves to float about on  <eos>
<sos> cactuses  flowery meads  snaky lianas they call them  wonder is it like <eos>
<sos> that  those cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente  <eos>
<sos> not doing a hand is turn all day  sleep six months out of twelve  too <eos>
<sos> hot to quarrel  influence of the climate  lethargy  flowers of <eos>
<sos> idleness  the air feeds most  azotes  hothouse in botanic gardens  <eos>
<sos> sensitive plants  waterlilies  petals too tired to  sleeping sickness <eos>
<sos> in the air  walk on roseleaves  imagine trying to eat tripe and <eos>
<sos> cowheel  where was the chap i saw in that picture somewhere  ah yes  in <eos>
<sos> the dead sea floating on his back  reading a book with a parasol open  <eos>
<sos> could not sink if you tried  so thick with salt  because the weight of <eos>
<sos> the water  no  the weight of the body in the water is equal to the <eos>
<sos> weight of the what  or is it the volume is equal to the weight  it is a <eos>
<sos> law something like that  vance in high school cracking his <eos>
<sos> fingerjoints  teaching  the college curriculum  cracking curriculum  <eos>
<sos> what is weight really when you say the weight  thirtytwo feet per <eos>
<sos> second per second  law of falling bodies  per second per second  they <eos>
<sos> all fall to the ground  the earth  it is the force of gravity of the <eos>
<sos> earth is the weight  <eos>
<sos> he turned away and sauntered across the road  how did she walk with her <eos>
<sos> sausages  like that something  as he walked he took the folded <eos>
<sos> freeman from his sidepocket  unfolded it  rolled it lengthwise in a <eos>
<sos> baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg  <eos>
<sos> careless air  just drop in to see  per second per second  per second <eos>
<sos> for every second it means  from the curbstone he darted a keen glance <eos>
<sos> through the door of the postoffice  too late box  post here  no one  <eos>
<sos> in  <eos>
<sos> he handed the card through the brass grill  <eos>
<sos>  are there any letters for me  he asked  <eos>
<sos> while the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting <eos>
<sos> poster with soldiers of all arms on parade  and held the tip of his <eos>
<sos> baton against his nostrils  smelling freshprinted rag paper  no answer <eos>
<sos> probably  went too far last time  <eos>
<sos> the postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a <eos>
<sos> letter  he thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope  <eos>
<sos> henry flower esq  <eos>
<sos> c o p  o  westland row  <eos>
<sos> city  <eos>
<sos> answered anyhow  he slipped card and letter into his sidepocket  <eos>
<sos> reviewing again the soldiers on parade  where is old tweedy is regiment  <eos>
<sos> castoff soldier  there  bearskin cap and hackle plume  no  he is a <eos>
<sos> grenadier  pointed cuffs  there he is  royal dublin fusiliers  <eos>
<sos> redcoats  too showy  that must be why the women go after them  uniform  <eos>
<sos> easier to enlist and drill  maud gonne is letter about taking them off <eos>
<sos> o connell street at night  disgrace to our irish capital  griffith is <eos>
<sos> paper is on the same tack now  an army rotten with venereal disease  <eos>
<sos> overseas or halfseasover empire  half baked they look  hypnotised like  <eos>
<sos> eyes front  mark time  table  able  bed  ed  the king is own  never see <eos>
<sos> him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby  a mason  yes  <eos>
<sos> he strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right  talk  as if <eos>
<sos> that would mend matters  his hand went into his pocket and a forefinger <eos>
<sos> felt its way under the flap of the envelope  ripping it open in jerks  <eos>
<sos> women will pay a lot of heed  i do not think  his fingers drew forth the <eos>
<sos> letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket  something <eos>
<sos> pinned on  photo perhaps  hair  no  <eos>

<sos> stood still  waiting  while the man  husband  brother  like her  <eos>
<sos> searched his pockets for change  stylish kind of coat with that roll <eos>

<sos> corners  rivetted edges  double action lever lock  bob cowley lent him <eos>

<sos> mr bloom  strolling towards brunswick street  smiled  my missus has <eos>
<sos> just got an  reedy freckled soprano  cheeseparing nose  nice enough in <eos>
<sos> its way  for a little ballad  no guts in it  you and me  do not you <eos>

<sos> that smallpox up there does not get worse  suppose she would not let <eos>
<sos> herself be vaccinated again  your wife and my wife  <eos>
<sos> wonder is he pimping after me  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom stood at the corner  his eyes wandering over the multicoloured <eos>
<sos> hoardings  cantrell and cochrane is ginger ale  aromatic   clery is <eos>
<sos> summer sale  no  he is going on straight  hello  leah tonight  mrs <eos>
<sos> bandmann palmer  like to see her again in that  hamlet she played <eos>
<sos> last night  male impersonator  perhaps he was a woman  why ophelia <eos>
<sos> committed suicide  poor papa  how he used to talk of kate bateman in <eos>
<sos> that  outside the adelphi in london waited all the afternoon to get in  <eos>
<sos> year before i was born that was  sixtyfive  and ristori in vienna  what <eos>
<sos> is this the right name is  by mosenthal it is  rachel  is it  no  the <eos>
<sos> scene he was always talking about where the old blind abraham <eos>
<sos> recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face  <eos>
<sos> nathan is voice  his son is voice  i hear the voice of nathan who left <eos>
<sos> his father to die of grief and misery in my arms  who left the house of <eos>
<sos> his father and left the god of his father  <eos>
<sos> every word is so deep  leopold  <eos>
<sos> poor papa  poor man  i am glad i did not go into the room to look at his <eos>
<sos> face  that day  o  dear  o  dear  ffoo  well  perhaps it was best for <eos>
<sos> him  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the <eos>
<sos> hazard  no use thinking of it any more  nosebag time  wish i had not met <eos>
<sos> that m coy fellow  <eos>
<sos> he came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats  the gently <eos>
<sos> champing teeth  their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by  amid <eos>
<sos> the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss  their eldorado  poor jugginses  damn <eos>
<sos> all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in <eos>
<sos> nosebags  too full for words  still they get their feed all right and <eos>
<sos> their doss  gelded too  a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp <eos>
<sos> between their haunches  might be happy all the same that way  good poor <eos>
<sos> brutes they look  still their neigh can be very irritating  <eos>
<sos> he drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he <eos>
<sos> carried  might just walk into her here  the lane is safer  <eos>
<sos> he passed the cabman is shelter  curious the life of drifting cabbies  <eos>
<sos> all weathers  all places  time or setdown  no will of their own  <eos>
<sos> voglio e non  like to give them an odd cigarette  sociable  shout a <eos>
<sos> few flying syllables as they pass  he hummed  <eos>
<sos> là ci darem la mano <eos>
<sos> la la lala la la  <eos>
<sos> he turned into cumberland street and  going on some paces  halted in <eos>
<sos> the lee of the station wall  no one  meade is timberyard  piled balks  <eos>
<sos> ruins and tenements  with careful tread he passed over a hopscotch <eos>
<sos> court with its forgotten pickeystone  not a sinner  near the timberyard <eos>
<sos> a squatted child at marbles  alone  shooting the taw with a cunnythumb  <eos>
<sos> a wise tabby  a blinking sphinx  watched from her warm sill  pity to <eos>
<sos> disturb them  mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her  <eos>
<sos> open it  and once i played marbles when i went to that old dame is <eos>
<sos> school  she liked mignonette  mrs ellis is  and mr  he opened the letter <eos>
<sos> within the newspaper  <eos>
<sos> a flower  i think it is a  a yellow flower with flattened petals  not <eos>
<sos> annoyed then  what does she say  <eos>

<sos> martha <eos>
<sos> p  s  do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use  i want to <eos>
<sos> know  <eos>
<sos> he tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell <eos>
<sos> and placed it in his heart pocket  language of flowers  they like it <eos>
<sos> because no one can hear  or a poison bouquet to strike him down  then <eos>
<sos> walking slowly forward he read the letter again  murmuring here and <eos>
<sos> there a word  angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your <eos>
<sos> cactus if you do not please poor forgetmenot how i long violets to dear <eos>
<sos> roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife martha is <eos>

<sos> back in his sidepocket  <eos>
<sos> weak joy opened his lips  changed since the first letter  wonder did <eos>
<sos> she wrote it herself  doing the indignant  a girl of good family like <eos>
<sos> me  respectable character  could meet one sunday after the rosary  <eos>
<sos> thank you  not having any  usual love scrimmage  then running round <eos>
<sos> corners  bad as a row with molly  cigar has a cooling effect  narcotic  <eos>
<sos> go further next time  naughty boy  punish  afraid of words  of course  <eos>
<sos> brutal  why not  try it anyhow  a bit at a time  <eos>
<sos> fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it  <eos>
<sos> common pin  eh  he threw it on the road  out of her clothes somewhere  <eos>
<sos> pinned together  queer the number of pins they always have  no roses <eos>
<sos> without thorns  <eos>
<sos> flat dublin voices bawled in his head  those two sluts that night in <eos>
<sos> the coombe  linked together in the rain  <eos>
<sos> o  mairy lost the pin of her drawers  <eos>
<sos> she did not know what to do <eos>
<sos> to keep it up  <eos>
<sos> to keep it up  <eos>
<sos> it  them  such a bad headache  has her roses probably  or sitting all <eos>
<sos> day typing  eyefocus bad for stomach nerves  what perfume does your <eos>
<sos> wife use  now could you make out a thing like that  <eos>
<sos> to keep it up  <eos>
<sos> martha  mary  i saw that picture somewhere i forget now old master or <eos>
<sos> faked for money  he is sitting in their house  talking  mysterious  <eos>
<sos> also the two sluts in the coombe would listen  <eos>
<sos> to keep it up  <eos>
<sos> nice kind of evening feeling  no more wandering about  just loll there  <eos>
<sos> quiet dusk  let everything rip  forget  tell about places you have <eos>
<sos> been  strange customs  the other one  jar on her head  was getting the <eos>
<sos> supper  fruit  olives  lovely cool water out of a well  stonecold like <eos>
<sos> the hole in the wall at ashtown  must carry a paper goblet next time i <eos>
<sos> go to the trottingmatches  she listens with big dark soft eyes  tell <eos>
<sos> her  more and more  all  then a sigh  silence  long long long rest  <eos>
<sos> going under the railway arch he took out the envelope  tore it swiftly <eos>
<sos> in shreds and scattered them towards the road  the shreds fluttered <eos>
<sos> away  sank in the dank air  a white flutter  then all sank  <eos>
<sos> henry flower  you could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the <eos>
<sos> same way  simple bit of paper  lord iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure <eos>
<sos> cheque for a million in the bank of ireland  shows you the money to be <eos>
<sos> made out of porter  still the other brother lord ardilaun has to change <eos>
<sos> his shirt four times a day  they say  skin breeds lice or vermin  a <eos>
<sos> million pounds  wait a moment  twopence a pint  fourpence a quart  <eos>
<sos> eightpence a gallon of porter  no  one and fourpence a gallon of <eos>
<sos> porter  one and four into twenty  fifteen about  yes  exactly  fifteen <eos>
<sos> millions of barrels of porter  <eos>
<sos> what am i saying barrels  gallons  about a million barrels all the <eos>
<sos> same  <eos>
<sos> an incoming train clanked heavily above his head  coach after coach  <eos>
<sos> barrels bumped in his head  dull porter slopped and churned inside  the <eos>
<sos> bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out  flowing <eos>
<sos> together  winding through mudflats all over the level land  a lazy <eos>
<sos> pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth  <eos>
<sos> he had reached the open backdoor of all hallows  stepping into the <eos>
<sos> porch he doffed his hat  took the card from his pocket and tucked it <eos>
<sos> again behind the leather headband  damn it  i might have tried to work <eos>
<sos> m coy for a pass to mullingar  <eos>
<sos> same notice on the door  sermon by the very reverend john conmee s  j  <eos>
<sos> on saint peter claver s  j  and the african mission  prayers for the <eos>
<sos> conversion of gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious  <eos>
<sos> the protestants are the same  convert dr william j  walsh d d  to the <eos>
<sos> true religion  save china is millions  wonder how they explain it to the <eos>
<sos> heathen chinee  prefer an ounce of opium  celestials  rank heresy for <eos>
<sos> them  buddha their god lying on his side in the museum  taking it easy <eos>
<sos> with hand under his cheek  josssticks burning  not like ecce homo  <eos>
<sos> crown of thorns and cross  clever idea saint patrick the shamrock  <eos>
<sos> chopsticks  conmee  martin cunningham knows him  distinguishedlooking  <eos>
<sos> sorry i did not work him about getting molly into the choir instead of <eos>
<sos> that father farley who looked a fool but was not  they re taught that  <eos>
<sos> he is not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to <eos>
<sos> baptise blacks  is he  the glasses would take their fancy  flashing  <eos>
<sos> like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips  entranced  <eos>
<sos> listening  still life  lap it up like milk  i suppose  <eos>
<sos> the cold smell of sacred stone called him  he trod the worn steps  <eos>
<sos> pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere  <eos>
<sos> something going on  some sodality  pity so empty  nice discreet place <eos>
<sos> to be next some girl  who is my neighbour  jammed by the hour to slow <eos>
<sos> music  that woman at midnight mass  seventh heaven  women knelt in the <eos>
<sos> benches with crimson halters round their necks  heads bowed  a batch <eos>
<sos> knelt at the altarrails  the priest went along by them  murmuring  <eos>
<sos> holding the thing in his hands  he stopped at each  took out a <eos>
<sos> communion  shook a drop or two  are they in water   off it and put it <eos>
<sos> neatly into her mouth  her hat and head sank  then the next one  her <eos>
<sos> hat sank at once  then the next one  a small old woman  the priest bent <eos>
<sos> down to put it into her mouth  murmuring all the time  latin  the next <eos>
<sos> one  shut your eyes and open your mouth  what  corpus  body  corpse  <eos>
<sos> good idea the latin  stupefies them first  hospice for the dying  they <eos>
<sos> do not seem to chew it  only swallow it down  rum idea  eating bits of a <eos>
<sos> corpse  why the cannibals cotton to it  <eos>
<sos> he stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle  one by <eos>
<sos> one  and seek their places  he approached a bench and seated himself in <eos>
<sos> its corner  nursing his hat and newspaper  these pots we have to wear  <eos>
<sos> we ought to have hats modelled on our heads  they were about him here <eos>
<sos> and there  with heads still bowed in their crimson halters  waiting for <eos>
<sos> it to melt in their stomachs  something like those mazzoth  it is that <eos>
<sos> sort of bread  unleavened shewbread  look at them  now i bet it makes <eos>
<sos> them feel happy  lollipop  it does  yes  bread of angels it is called  <eos>
<sos> there is a big idea behind it  kind of kingdom of god is within you <eos>
<sos> feel  first communicants  hokypoky penny a lump  then feel all like one <eos>
<sos> family party  same in the theatre  all in the same swim  they do  i am <eos>
<sos> sure of that  not so lonely  in our confraternity  then come out a bit <eos>
<sos> spreeish  let off steam  thing is if you really believe in it  lourdes <eos>
<sos> cure  waters of oblivion  and the knock apparition  statues bleeding  <eos>
<sos> old fellow asleep near that confessionbox  hence those snores  blind <eos>
<sos> faith  safe in the arms of kingdom come  lulls all pain  wake this time <eos>
<sos> next year  <eos>
<sos> he saw the priest stow the communion cup away  well in  and kneel an <eos>
<sos> instant before it  showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace <eos>
<sos> affair he had on  suppose he lost the pin of his  he would not know what <eos>
<sos> to do to  bald spot behind  letters on his back  i n r i  no  i h s  <eos>
<sos> molly told me one time i asked her  i have sinned  or no  i have <eos>
<sos> suffered  it is  and the other one  iron nails ran in  <eos>
<sos> meet one sunday after the rosary  do not deny my request  turn up with <eos>
<sos> a veil and black bag  dusk and the light behind her  she might be here <eos>
<sos> with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the <eos>
<sos> sly  their character  that fellow that turned queen is evidence on the <eos>
<sos> invincibles he used to receive the  carey was his name  the communion <eos>
<sos> every morning  this very church  peter carey  yes  no  peter claver i <eos>
<sos> am thinking of  denis carey  and just imagine that  wife and six <eos>
<sos> children at home  and plotting that murder all the time  those <eos>
<sos> crawthumpers  now that is a good name for them  there is always something <eos>
<sos> shiftylooking about them  they re not straight men of business either  <eos>
<sos> o  no  she is not here  the flower  no  no  by the way  did i tear up <eos>
<sos> that envelope  yes  under the bridge  <eos>
<sos> the priest was rinsing out the chalice  then he tossed off the dregs <eos>
<sos> smartly  wine  makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank <eos>

<sos> stream  this is my body  <eos>
<sos> he foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full  naked  in a womb of <eos>
<sos> warmth  oiled by scented melting soap  softly laved  he saw his trunk <eos>
<sos> and limbs riprippled over and sustained  buoyed lightly upward  <eos>
<sos> lemonyellow  his navel  bud of flesh  and saw the dark tangled curls of <eos>
<sos> his bush floating  floating hair of the stream around the limp father <eos>
<sos> of thousands  a languid floating flower  <eos>
<sos>   6   <eos>
<sos> martin cunningham  first  poked his silkhatted head into the creaking <eos>
<sos> carriage and  entering deftly  seated himself  mr power stepped in <eos>
<sos> after him  curving his height with care  <eos>
<sos>  come on  simon  <eos>

<sos> mr dedalus covered himself quickly and got in  saying  <eos>
<sos>  yes  yes  <eos>

<sos> mr bloom entered and sat in the vacant place  he pulled the door to <eos>
<sos> after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight  he passed an arm <eos>
<sos> through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow <eos>
<sos> at the lowered blinds of the avenue  one dragged aside  an old woman <eos>
<sos> peeping  nose whiteflattened against the pane  thanking her stars she <eos>
<sos> was passed over  extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse  glad <eos>
<sos> to see us go we give them such trouble coming  job seems to suit them  <eos>

<sos> sitting on something hard  ah  that soap  in my hip pocket  better <eos>
<sos> shift it out of that  wait for an opportunity  <eos>
<sos> all waited  then wheels were heard from in front  turning  then nearer  <eos>
<sos> then horses  hoofs  a jolt  their carriage began to move  creaking and <eos>
<sos> swaying  other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind  the blinds of <eos>
<sos> the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker  door ajar  <eos>
<sos> at walking pace  <eos>
<sos> they waited still  their knees jogging  till they had turned and were <eos>
<sos> passing along the tramtracks  tritonville road  quicker  the wheels <eos>
<sos> rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook <eos>
<sos> rattling in the doorframes  <eos>
<sos>  what way is he taking us  mr power asked through both windows  <eos>
<sos>  irishtown  martin cunningham said  ringsend  brunswick street  <eos>
<sos> mr dedalus nodded  looking out  <eos>
<sos>  that is a fine old custom  he said  i am glad to see it has not died <eos>
<sos> out  <eos>
<sos> all watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by <eos>
<sos> passers  respect  the carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the <eos>
<sos> smoother road past watery lane  mr bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man  <eos>
<sos> clad in mourning  a wide hat  <eos>
<sos>  there is a friend of yours gone by  dedalus  he said  <eos>
<sos>  who is that  <eos>
<sos>  your son and heir  <eos>
<sos>  where is he  mr dedalus said  stretching over across  <eos>
<sos> the carriage  passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway <eos>
<sos> before the tenement houses  lurched round the corner and  swerving back <eos>
<sos> to the tramtrack  rolled on noisily with chattering wheels  mr dedalus <eos>
<sos> fell back  saying  <eos>
<sos>  was that mulligan cad with him  his fidus achates  <eos>
<sos>  no  mr bloom said  he was alone  <eos>
<sos>  down with his aunt sally  i suppose  mr dedalus said  the goulding <eos>
<sos> faction  the drunken little costdrawer and crissie  papa is little lump <eos>
<sos> of dung  the wise child that knows her own father  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom smiled joylessly on ringsend road  wallace bros  the <eos>

<sos> richie goulding and the legal bag  goulding  collis and ward he calls <eos>
<sos> the firm  his jokes are getting a bit damp  great card he was  waltzing <eos>

<sos> ironing his back  thinks he ll cure it with pills  all breadcrumbs they <eos>
<sos> are  about six hundred per cent profit  <eos>
<sos>  he is in with a lowdown crowd  mr dedalus snarled  that mulligan is a <eos>
<sos> contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts  his name stinks <eos>
<sos> all over dublin  but with the help of god and his blessed mother i ll <eos>
<sos> make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother <eos>
<sos> or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a <eos>
<sos> gate  i ll tickle his catastrophe  believe you me  <eos>
<sos> he cried above the clatter of the wheels  <eos>
<sos>  i wo not have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son  a counterjumper is <eos>
<sos> son  selling tapes in my cousin  peter paul m swiney is  not likely  <eos>
<sos> he ceased  mr bloom glanced from his angry moustache to mr power is mild <eos>
<sos> face and martin cunningham is eyes and beard  gravely shaking  noisy <eos>
<sos> selfwilled man  full of his son  he is right  something to hand on  if <eos>

<sos> the carriage heeled over and back  their four trunks swaying  <eos>
<sos>  corny might have given us a more commodious yoke  mr power said  <eos>
<sos>  he might  mr dedalus said  if he had not that squint troubling him  do <eos>
<sos> you follow me  <eos>
<sos> he closed his left eye  martin cunningham began to brush away <eos>
<sos> crustcrumbs from under his thighs  <eos>
<sos>  what is this  he said  in the name of god  crumbs  <eos>
<sos>  someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately  mr power <eos>
<sos> said  <eos>
<sos> all raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless <eos>
<sos> leather of the seats  mr dedalus  twisting his nose  frowned downward <eos>
<sos> and said  <eos>
<sos>  unless i am greatly mistaken  what do you think  martin  <eos>
<sos>  it struck me too  martin cunningham said  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom set his thigh down  glad i took that bath  feel my feet quite <eos>
<sos> clean  but i wish mrs fleming had darned these socks better  <eos>
<sos> mr dedalus sighed resignedly  <eos>
<sos>  after all  he said  it is the most natural thing in the world  <eos>
<sos>  did tom kernan turn up  martin cunningham asked  twirling the peak of <eos>
<sos> his beard gently  <eos>
<sos>  yes  mr bloom answered  he is behind with ned lambert and hynes  <eos>
<sos>  and corny kelleher himself  mr power asked  <eos>
<sos>  at the cemetery  martin cunningham said  <eos>

<sos> the carriage halted short  <eos>
<sos>  what is wrong  <eos>

<sos> a dying scrawl  he took it to heart  pined away  quiet brute  old men is <eos>
<sos> dogs usually are  <eos>
<sos> a raindrop spat on his hat  he drew back and saw an instant of shower <eos>
<sos> spray dots over the grey flags  apart  curious  like through a <eos>
<sos> colander  i thought it would  my boots were creaking i remember now  <eos>
<sos>  the weather is changing  he said quietly  <eos>
<sos>  a pity it did not keep up fine  martin cunningham said  <eos>
<sos>  wanted for the country  mr power said  there is the sun again coming <eos>
<sos> out  <eos>
<sos> mr dedalus  peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun  hurled <eos>
<sos> a mute curse at the sky  <eos>
<sos>  it is as uncertain as a child is bottom  he said  <eos>
<sos>  we re off again  <eos>
<sos> the carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed <eos>
<sos> gently  martin cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard  <eos>
<sos>  tom kernan was immense last night  he said  and paddy leonard taking <eos>
<sos> him off to his face  <eos>
<sos>  o  draw him out  martin  mr power said eagerly  wait till you hear <eos>

<sos> of elvery is elephant house  showed them a curved hand open on his <eos>
<sos> spine  <eos>
<sos>  in all his pristine beauty  mr power said  <eos>
<sos> mr dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly  <eos>
<sos>  the devil break the hasp of your back  <eos>
<sos> mr power  collapsing in laughter  shaded his face from the window as <eos>
<sos> the carriage passed gray is statue  <eos>
<sos>  we have all been there  martin cunningham said broadly  <eos>
<sos> his eyes met mr bloom is eyes  he caressed his beard  adding  <eos>
<sos>  well  nearly all of us  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions  faces  <eos>
<sos>  that is an awfully good one that is going the rounds about reuben j and <eos>
<sos> the son  <eos>
<sos>  about the boatman  mr power asked  <eos>
<sos>  yes  is not it awfully good  <eos>

<sos> to drown      <eos>
<sos>  drown barabbas  mr dedalus cried  i wish to christ he did  <eos>
<sos> mr power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils  <eos>
<sos>  no  mr bloom said  the son himself      <eos>
<sos> martin cunningham thwarted his speech rudely  <eos>
<sos>  reuben j and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on <eos>
<sos> their way to the isle of man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got <eos>
<sos> loose and over the wall with him into the liffey  <eos>
<sos>  for god is sake  mr dedalus exclaimed in fright  is he dead  <eos>
<sos>  dead  martin cunningham cried  not he  a boatman got a pole and fished <eos>
<sos> him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father <eos>
<sos> on the quay more dead than alive  half the town was there  <eos>
<sos>  yes  mr bloom said  but the funny part is      <eos>
<sos>  and reuben j  martin cunningham said  gave the boatman a florin for <eos>
<sos> saving his son is life  <eos>
<sos> a stifled sigh came from under mr power is hand  <eos>
<sos>  o  he did  martin cunningham affirmed  like a hero  a silver florin  <eos>

<sos> mr dedalus sighed  <eos>
<sos>  ah then indeed  he said  poor little paddy would not grudge us a laugh  <eos>
<sos> many a good one he told himself  <eos>
<sos>  the lord forgive me  mr power said  wiping his wet eyes with his <eos>
<sos> fingers  poor paddy  i little thought a week ago when i saw him last <eos>
<sos> and he was in his usual health that i d be driving after him like this  <eos>
<sos> he is gone from us  <eos>
<sos>  as decent a little man as ever wore a hat  mr dedalus said  he went <eos>
<sos> very suddenly  <eos>

<sos> he tapped his chest sadly  <eos>
<sos> blazing face  redhot  too much john barleycorn  cure for a red nose  <eos>
<sos> drink like the devil till it turns adelite  a lot of money he spent <eos>
<sos> colouring it  <eos>
<sos> mr power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension  <eos>
<sos>  he had a sudden death  poor fellow  he said  <eos>
<sos>  the best death  mr bloom said  <eos>
<sos> their wide open eyes looked at him  <eos>
<sos>  no suffering  he said  a moment and all is over  like dying in sleep  <eos>
<sos> no one spoke  <eos>
<sos> dead side of the street this  dull business by day  land agents  <eos>

<sos> nothing  mistake of nature  if it is healthy it is from the mother  if <eos>
<sos> not from the man  better luck next time  <eos>
<sos>  poor little thing  mr dedalus said  it is well out of it  <eos>
<sos> the carriage climbed more slowly the hill of rutland square  rattle his <eos>
<sos> bones  over the stones  only a pauper  nobody owns  <eos>
<sos>  in the midst of life  martin cunningham said  <eos>
<sos>  but the worst of all  mr power said  is the man who takes his own <eos>
<sos> life  <eos>
<sos> martin cunningham drew out his watch briskly  coughed and put it back  <eos>
<sos>  the greatest disgrace to have in the family  mr power added  <eos>
<sos>  temporary insanity  of course  martin cunningham said decisively  we <eos>
<sos> must take a charitable view of it  <eos>
<sos>  they say a man who does it is a coward  mr dedalus said  <eos>
<sos>  it is not for us to judge  martin cunningham said  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom  about to speak  closed his lips again  martin cunningham is <eos>
<sos> large eyes  looking away now  sympathetic human man he is  intelligent  <eos>
<sos> like shakespeare is face  always a good word to say  they have no mercy <eos>
<sos> on that here or infanticide  refuse christian burial  they used to <eos>
<sos> drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave  as if it was not <eos>
<sos> broken already  yet sometimes they repent too late  found in the <eos>
<sos> riverbed clutching rushes  he looked at me  and that awful drunkard of <eos>
<sos> a wife of his  setting up house for her time after time and then <eos>
<sos> pawning the furniture on him every saturday almost  leading him the <eos>
<sos> life of the damned  wear the heart out of a stone  that  monday <eos>

<sos> looked a sight that night dedalus told me he was in there  drunk about <eos>
<sos> the place and capering with martin is umbrella  <eos>
<sos> and they call me the jewel of asia  <eos>
<sos> of asia  <eos>

<sos> he looked away from me  he knows  rattle his bones  <eos>
<sos> that afternoon of the inquest  the redlabelled bottle on the table  the <eos>
<sos> room in the hotel with hunting pictures  stuffy it was  sunlight <eos>
<sos> through the slats of the venetian blind  the coroner is sunlit ears  big <eos>

<sos> bed  verdict  overdose  death by misadventure  the letter  for my son <eos>
<sos> leopold  <eos>
<sos> no more pain  wake no more  nobody owns  <eos>
<sos> the carriage rattled swiftly along blessington street  over the stones  <eos>
<sos>  we are going the pace  i think  martin cunningham said  <eos>
<sos>  god grant he does not upset us on the road  mr power said  <eos>
<sos>  i hope not  martin cunningham said  that will be a great race tomorrow <eos>
<sos> in germany  the gordon bennett  <eos>
<sos>  yes  by jove  mr dedalus said  that will be worth seeing  faith  <eos>

<sos> that was dressed that bite the bee gave me  he is gone over to the <eos>
<sos> lying in hospital they told me  from one extreme to the other  <eos>
<sos> the carriage galloped round a corner  stopped  <eos>
<sos>  what is wrong now  <eos>
<sos> a divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows  lowing  slouching <eos>
<sos> by on padded hoofs  whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony <eos>
<sos> croups  outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their <eos>
<sos> fear  <eos>
<sos>  emigrants  mr power said  <eos>
<sos>  huuuh  the drover is voice cried  his switch sounding on their flanks  <eos>
<sos> huuuh  out of that  <eos>

<sos> soap  margarine  wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off <eos>
<sos> the train at clonsilla  <eos>
<sos> the carriage moved on through the drove  <eos>
<sos>  i ca not make out why the corporation does not run a tramline from the <eos>
<sos> parkgate to the quays  mr bloom said  all those animals could be taken <eos>
<sos> in trucks down to the boats  <eos>
<sos>  instead of blocking up the thoroughfare  martin cunningham said  quite <eos>
<sos> right  they ought to  <eos>
<sos>  yes  mr bloom said  and another thing i often thought  is to have <eos>
<sos> municipal funeral trams like they have in milan  you know  run the line <eos>
<sos> out to the cemetery gates and have special trams  hearse and carriage <eos>
<sos> and all  do not you see what i mean  <eos>
<sos>  o  that be damned for a story  mr dedalus said  pullman car and saloon <eos>
<sos> diningroom  <eos>
<sos>  a poor lookout for corny  mr power added  <eos>
<sos>  why  mr bloom asked  turning to mr dedalus  would not it be more decent <eos>
<sos> than galloping two abreast  <eos>
<sos>  well  there is something in that  mr dedalus granted  <eos>
<sos>  and  martin cunningham said  we would not have scenes like that when <eos>
<sos> the hearse capsized round dunphy is and upset the coffin on to the road  <eos>
<sos>  that was terrible  mr power is shocked face said  and the corpse fell <eos>
<sos> about the road  terrible  <eos>
<sos>  first round dunphy is  mr dedalus said  nodding  gordon bennett cup  <eos>
<sos>  praises be to god  martin cunningham said piously  <eos>
<sos> bom  upset  a coffin bumped out on to the road  burst open  paddy <eos>
<sos> dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too <eos>
<sos> large for him  red face  grey now  mouth fallen open  asking what is up <eos>
<sos> now  quite right to close it  looks horrid open  then the insides <eos>
<sos> decompose quickly  much better to close up all the orifices  yes  also  <eos>
<sos> with wax  the sphincter loose  seal up all  <eos>
<sos>  dunphy is  mr power announced as the carriage turned right  <eos>
<sos> dunphy is corner  mourning coaches drawn up  drowning their grief  a <eos>
<sos> pause by the wayside  tiptop position for a pub  expect we ll pull up <eos>
<sos> here on the way back to drink his health  pass round the consolation  <eos>
<sos> elixir of life  <eos>
<sos> but suppose now it did happen  would he bleed if a nail say cut him in <eos>
<sos> the knocking about  he would and he would not  i suppose  depends on <eos>
<sos> where  the circulation stops  still some might ooze out of an artery  <eos>
<sos> it would be better to bury them in red  a dark red  <eos>
<sos> in silence they drove along phibsborough road  an empty hearse trotted <eos>
<sos> by  coming from the cemetery  looks relieved  <eos>
<sos> crossguns bridge  the royal canal  <eos>
<sos> water rushed roaring through the sluices  a man stood on his dropping <eos>
<sos> barge  between clamps of turf  on the towpath by the lock a <eos>
<sos> slacktethered horse  aboard of the bugabu  <eos>
<sos> their eyes watched him  on the slow weedy waterway he had floated on <eos>
<sos> his raft coastward over ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of <eos>
<sos> reeds  over slime  mudchoked bottles  carrion dogs  athlone  mullingar  <eos>
<sos> moyvalley  i could make a walking tour to see milly by the canal  or <eos>
<sos> cycle down  hire some old crock  safety  wren had one the other day at <eos>

<sos> lock to dublin  with turf from the midland bogs  salute  he lifted his <eos>
<sos> brown straw hat  saluting paddy dignam  <eos>
<sos> they drove on past brian boroimhe house  near it now  <eos>
<sos>  i wonder how is our friend fogarty getting on  mr power said  <eos>
<sos>  better ask tom kernan  mr dedalus said  <eos>
<sos>  how is that  martin cunningham said  left him weeping  i suppose  <eos>
<sos>  though lost to sight  mr dedalus said  to memory dear  <eos>
<sos> the carriage steered left for finglas road  <eos>
<sos> the stonecutter is yard on the right  last lap  crowded on the spit of <eos>
<sos> land silent shapes appeared  white  sorrowful  holding out calm hands  <eos>
<sos> knelt in grief  pointing  fragments of shapes  hewn  in white silence  <eos>
<sos> appealing  the best obtainable  thos  h  dennany  monumental builder <eos>
<sos> and sculptor  <eos>
<sos> passed  <eos>
<sos> on the curbstone before jimmy geary  the sexton is  an old tramp sat  <eos>
<sos> grumbling  emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown <eos>
<sos> yawning boot  after life is journey  <eos>
<sos> gloomy gardens then went by  one by one  gloomy houses  <eos>
<sos> mr power pointed  <eos>
<sos>  that is where childs was murdered  he said  the last house  <eos>
<sos>  so it is  mr dedalus said  a gruesome case  seymour bushe got him off  <eos>
<sos> murdered his brother  or so they said  <eos>
<sos>  the crown had no evidence  mr power said  <eos>
<sos>  only circumstantial  martin cunningham added  that is the maxim of the <eos>
<sos> law  better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent <eos>
<sos> person to be wrongfully condemned  <eos>
<sos> they looked  murderer is ground  it passed darkly  shuttered  <eos>
<sos> tenantless  unweeded garden  whole place gone to hell  wrongfully <eos>
<sos> condemned  murder  the murderer is image in the eye of the murdered  <eos>
<sos> they love reading about it  man is head found in a garden  her clothing <eos>
<sos> consisted of  how she met her death  recent outrage  the weapon used  <eos>
<sos> murderer is still at large  clues  a shoelace  the body to be exhumed  <eos>
<sos> murder will out  <eos>
<sos> cramped in this carriage  she might not like me to come that way without <eos>
<sos> letting her know  must be careful about women  catch them once with <eos>
<sos> their pants down  never forgive you after  fifteen  <eos>
<sos> the high railings of prospect rippled past their gaze  dark poplars  <eos>
<sos> rare white forms  forms more frequent  white shapes thronged amid the <eos>
<sos> trees  white forms and fragments streaming by mutely  sustaining vain <eos>
<sos> gestures on the air  <eos>
<sos> the felly harshed against the curbstone  stopped  martin cunningham put <eos>
<sos> out his arm and  wrenching back the handle  shoved the door open with <eos>
<sos> his knee  he stepped out  mr power and mr dedalus followed  <eos>
<sos> change that soap now  mr bloom is hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly <eos>
<sos> and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket  <eos>
<sos> he stepped out of the carriage  replacing the newspaper his other hand <eos>
<sos> still held  <eos>
<sos> paltry funeral  coach and three carriages  it is all the same  <eos>
<sos> pallbearers  gold reins  requiem mass  firing a volley  pomp of death  <eos>
<sos> beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and <eos>
<sos> fruit  simnel cakes those are  stuck together  cakes for the dead  <eos>
<sos> dogbiscuits  who ate them  mourners coming out  <eos>
<sos> he followed his companions  mr kernan and ned lambert followed  hynes <eos>
<sos> walking after them  corny kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took <eos>
<sos> out the two wreaths  he handed one to the boy  <eos>
<sos> where is that child is funeral disappeared to  <eos>
<sos> a team of horses passed from finglas with toiling plodding tread  <eos>
<sos> dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a <eos>
<sos> granite block  the waggoner marching at their head saluted  <eos>
<sos> coffin now  got here before us  dead as he is  horse looking round at <eos>
<sos> it with his plume skeowways  dull eye  collar tight on his neck  <eos>
<sos> pressing on a bloodvessel or something  do they know what they cart out <eos>

<sos> hard woman at a bargain  her bonnet awry  girl is face stained with dirt <eos>
<sos> and tears  holding the woman is arm  looking up at her for a sign to <eos>
<sos> cry  fish is face  bloodless and livid  <eos>
<sos> the mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates  so <eos>
<sos> much dead weight  felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath  first <eos>
<sos> the stiff  then the friends of the stiff  corny kelleher and the boy <eos>
<sos> followed with their wreaths  who is that beside them  ah  the <eos>
<sos> brother in law  <eos>

<sos> towards the cardinal is mausoleum  speaking  <eos>

<sos> substance  something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back  <eos>
<sos> waiting  it never comes  one must go first  alone  under the ground  <eos>
<sos> and lie no more in her warm bed  <eos>

<sos> they halted about the door of the mortuary chapel  mr bloom stood <eos>
<sos> behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and <eos>
<sos> at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar  poor boy  was <eos>

<sos> after a moment he followed the others in  blinking in the screened <eos>
<sos> light  the coffin lay on its bier before the chancel  four tall yellow <eos>
<sos> candles at its corners  always in front of us  corny kelleher  laying a <eos>
<sos> wreath at each fore corner  beckoned to the boy to kneel  the mourners <eos>

<sos> one hand  balancing with the other a little book against his toad is <eos>
<sos> belly  who ll read the book  i  said the rook  <eos>
<sos> they halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book <eos>
<sos> with a fluent croak  <eos>
<sos> father coffey  i knew his name was like a coffin  dominenamine  bully <eos>
<sos> about the muzzle he looks  bosses the show  muscular christian  woe <eos>

<sos> the priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy is <eos>
<sos> bucket and shook it over the coffin  then he walked to the other end <eos>
<sos> and shook it again  then he came back and put it back in the bucket  as <eos>
<sos> you were before you rested  it is all written down  he has to do it  <eos>
<sos>  et ne nos inducas in tentationem  <eos>
<sos> the server piped the answers in the treble  i often thought it would be <eos>
<sos> better to have boy servants  up to fifteen or so  after that  of course <eos>
<sos> holy water that was  i expect  shaking sleep out of it  he must be fed <eos>
<sos> up with that job  shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up  <eos>

<sos> the priest closed his book and went off  followed by the server  corny <eos>
<sos> kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in  hoisted the <eos>
<sos> coffin again  carried it out and shoved it on their cart  corny <eos>
<sos> kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother in law  all <eos>
<sos> followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air  mr bloom <eos>
<sos> came last folding his paper again into his pocket  he gazed gravely at <eos>
<sos> the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left  the metal <eos>
<sos> wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt <eos>
<sos> boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres  <eos>
<sos> the ree the ra the ree the ra the roo  lord  i must not lilt here  <eos>
<sos>  the o connell circle  mr dedalus said about him  <eos>
<sos> mr power is soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone  <eos>
<sos>  he is at rest  he said  in the middle of his people  old dan o   but <eos>
<sos> his heart is buried in rome  how many broken hearts are buried here  <eos>
<sos> simon  <eos>
<sos>  her grave is over there  jack  mr dedalus said  i ll soon be stretched <eos>
<sos> beside her  let him take me whenever he likes  <eos>
<sos> breaking down  he began to weep to himself quietly  stumbling a little <eos>
<sos> in his walk  mr power took his arm  <eos>
<sos>  she is better where she is  he said kindly  <eos>
<sos>  i suppose so  mr dedalus said with a weak gasp  i suppose she is in <eos>
<sos> heaven if there is a heaven  <eos>
<sos> corny kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to <eos>
<sos> plod by  <eos>
<sos>  sad occasions  mr kernan began politely  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head  <eos>
<sos>  the others are putting on their hats  mr kernan said  i suppose we can <eos>
<sos> do so too  we are the last  this cemetery is a treacherous place  <eos>
<sos> they covered their heads  <eos>
<sos>  the reverend gentleman read the service too quickly  do not you think  <eos>
<sos> mr kernan said with reproof  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes  secret <eos>
<sos> eyes  secretsearching  mason  i think  not sure  beside him again  we <eos>
<sos> are the last  in the same boat  hope he ll say something else  <eos>
<sos> mr kernan added  <eos>
<sos>  the service of the irish church used in mount jerome is simpler  more <eos>
<sos> impressive i must say  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom gave prudent assent  the language of course was another thing  <eos>
<sos> mr kernan said with solemnity  <eos>
<sos>  i am the resurrection and the life  that touches a man is inmost <eos>
<sos> heart  <eos>
<sos>  it does  mr bloom said  <eos>
<sos> your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two <eos>
<sos> with his toes to the daisies  no touching that  seat of the affections  <eos>
<sos> broken heart  a pump after all  pumping thousands of gallons of blood <eos>
<sos> every day  one fine day it gets bunged up  and there you are  lots of <eos>
<sos> them lying around here  lungs  hearts  livers  old rusty pumps  damn <eos>
<sos> the thing else  the resurrection and the life  once you are dead you <eos>
<sos> are dead  that last day idea  knocking them all up out of their graves  <eos>
<sos> come forth  lazarus  and he came fifth and lost the job  get up  last <eos>

<sos> corny kelleher fell into step at their side  <eos>
<sos>  everything went off a1  he said  what  <eos>
<sos> he looked on them from his drawling eye  policeman is shoulders  with <eos>
<sos> your tooraloom tooraloom  <eos>
<sos>  as it should be  mr kernan said  <eos>
<sos>  what  eh  corny kelleher said  <eos>
<sos> mr kernan assured him  <eos>
<sos>  who is that chap behind with tom kernan  john henry menton asked  i <eos>

<sos>  what is he  he asked  what does he do  was not he in the stationery <eos>
<sos> line  i fell foul of him one evening  i remember  at bowls  <eos>
<sos> ned lambert smiled  <eos>
<sos>  yes  he was  he said  in wisdom hely is  a traveller for blottingpaper  <eos>
<sos>  in god is name  john henry menton said  what did she marry a coon like <eos>
<sos> that for  she had plenty of game in her then  <eos>
<sos>  has still  ned lambert said  he does some canvassing for ads  <eos>
<sos> john henry menton is large eyes stared ahead  <eos>
<sos> the barrow turned into a side lane  a portly man  ambushed among the <eos>
<sos> grasses  raised his hat in homage  the gravediggers touched their caps  <eos>
<sos>  john o connell  mr power said pleased  he never forgets a friend  <eos>
<sos> mr o connell shook all their hands in silence  mr dedalus said  <eos>
<sos>  i am come to pay you another visit  <eos>
<sos>  my dear simon  the caretaker answered in a low voice  i do not want <eos>
<sos> your custom at all  <eos>
<sos> saluting ned lambert and john henry menton he walked on at martin <eos>
<sos> cunningham is side puzzling two long keys at his back  <eos>
<sos>  did you hear that one  he asked them  about mulcahy from the coombe  <eos>
<sos>  i did not  martin cunningham said  <eos>
<sos> they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear  the <eos>
<sos> caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke <eos>
<sos> in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles  <eos>
<sos>  they tell the story  he said  that two drunks came out here one foggy <eos>
<sos> evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs  they asked for <eos>
<sos> mulcahy from the coombe and were told where he was buried  after <eos>
<sos> traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough  one of the <eos>
<sos> drunks spelt out the name  terence mulcahy  the other drunk was <eos>
<sos> blinking up at a statue of our saviour the widow had got put up  <eos>
<sos> the caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed  he <eos>
<sos> resumed  <eos>
<sos>  and  after blinking up at the sacred figure  _not a bloody bit like <eos>
<sos> the man  says he  that is not mulcahy  says he  whoever done it_  <eos>
<sos> rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher  <eos>
<sos> accepting the dockets given him  turning them over and scanning them as <eos>
<sos> he walked  <eos>
<sos>  that is all done with a purpose  martin cunningham explained to hynes  <eos>
<sos>  i know  hynes said  i know that  <eos>
<sos>  to cheer a fellow up  martin cunningham said  it is pure <eos>
<sos> goodheartedness  damn the thing else  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom admired the caretaker is prosperous bulk  all want to be on <eos>
<sos> good terms with him  decent fellow  john o connell  real good sort  <eos>

<sos> disturbed me writing to martha  hope it is not chucked in the dead <eos>
<sos> letter office  be the better of a shave  grey sprouting beard  that is <eos>
<sos> the first sign when the hairs come out grey  and temper getting cross  <eos>
<sos> silver threads among the grey  fancy being his wife  wonder he had the <eos>
<sos> gumption to propose to any girl  come out and live in the graveyard  <eos>
<sos> dangle that before her  it might thrill her first  courting death  <eos>
<sos> shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about  the <eos>
<sos> shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and daniel o connell must be <eos>
<sos> a descendant i suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy <eos>
<sos> man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark  will o  <eos>
<sos> the wisp  gas of graves  want to keep her mind off it to conceive at <eos>
<sos> all  women especially are so touchy  tell her a ghost story in bed to <eos>
<sos> make her sleep  have you ever seen a ghost  well  i have  it was a <eos>
<sos> pitchdark night  the clock was on the stroke of twelve  still they d <eos>
<sos> kiss all right if properly keyed up  whores in turkish graveyards  <eos>
<sos> learn anything if taken young  you might pick up a young widow here  <eos>
<sos> men like that  love among the tombstones  romeo  spice of pleasure  in <eos>
<sos> the midst of death we are in life  both ends meet  tantalising for the <eos>
<sos> poor dead  smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving  gnawing their <eos>
<sos> vitals  desire to grig people  molly wanting to do it at the window  <eos>
<sos> eight children he has anyway  <eos>
<sos> he has seen a fair share go under in his time  lying around him field <eos>
<sos> after field  holy fields  more room if they buried them standing  <eos>
<sos> sitting or kneeling you could not  standing  his head might come up some <eos>
<sos> day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing  all honeycombed <eos>
<sos> the ground must be  oblong cells  and very neat he keeps it too  trim <eos>
<sos> grass and edgings  his garden major gamble calls mount jerome  well  so <eos>
<sos> it is  ought to be flowers of sleep  chinese cemeteries with giant <eos>
<sos> poppies growing produce the best opium mastiansky told me  the botanic <eos>
<sos> gardens are just over there  it is the blood sinking in the earth gives <eos>
<sos> new life  same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy  <eos>
<sos> every man his price  well preserved fat corpse  gentleman  epicure  <eos>
<sos> invaluable for fruit garden  a bargain  by carcass of william <eos>
<sos> wilkinson  auditor and accountant  lately deceased  three pounds <eos>
<sos> thirteen and six  with thanks  <eos>
<sos> i daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure  bones  flesh  <eos>
<sos> nails  charnelhouses  dreadful  turning green and pink decomposing  rot <eos>
<sos> quick in damp earth  the lean old ones tougher  then a kind of a <eos>
<sos> tallowy kind of a cheesy  then begin to get black  black treacle oozing <eos>
<sos> out of them  then dried up  deathmoths  of course the cells or whatever <eos>
<sos> they are go on living  changing about  live for ever practically  <eos>
<sos> nothing to feed on feed on themselves  <eos>
<sos> but they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots  soil must be simply <eos>
<sos> swirling with them  your head it simply swurls  those pretty little <eos>
<sos> seaside gurls  he looks cheerful enough over it  gives him a sense of <eos>
<sos> power seeing all the others go under first  wonder how he looks at <eos>
<sos> life  cracking his jokes too  warms the cockles of his heart  the one <eos>
<sos> about the bulletin  spurgeon went to heaven 4 a m  this morning  11 <eos>
<sos> p m   closing time   not arrived yet  peter  the dead themselves the <eos>
<sos> men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what is <eos>
<sos> in fashion  a juicy pear or ladies  punch  hot  strong and sweet  keep <eos>
<sos> out the damp  you must laugh sometimes so better do it that way  <eos>
<sos> gravediggers in hamlet  shows the profound knowledge of the human <eos>
<sos> heart  dare not joke about the dead for two years at least  _de mortuis <eos>
<sos> nil nisi prius_  go out of mourning first  hard to imagine his funeral  <eos>
<sos> seems a sort of a joke  read your own obituary notice they say you live <eos>
<sos> longer  gives you second wind  new lease of life  <eos>
<sos>  how many have you for tomorrow  the caretaker asked  <eos>
<sos>  two  corny kelleher said  half ten and eleven  <eos>
<sos> the caretaker put the papers in his pocket  the barrow had ceased to <eos>
<sos> trundle  the mourners split and moved to each side of the hole  <eos>
<sos> stepping with care round the graves  the gravediggers bore the coffin <eos>
<sos> and set its nose on the brink  looping the bands round it  <eos>
<sos> burying him  we come to bury cæsar  his ides of march or june  he <eos>
<sos> does not know who is here nor care  now who is that lankylooking galoot <eos>
<sos> over there in the macintosh  now who is he i d like to know  now i d <eos>
<sos> give a trifle to know who he is  always someone turns up you never <eos>
<sos> dreamt of  a fellow could live on his lonesome all his life  yes  he <eos>
<sos> could  still he d have to get someone to sod him after he died though <eos>
<sos> he could dig his own grave  we all do  only man buries  no  ants too  <eos>
<sos> first thing strikes anybody  bury the dead  say robinson crusoe was <eos>
<sos> true to life  well then friday buried him  every friday buries a <eos>
<sos> thursday if you come to look at it  <eos>
<sos> o  poor robinson crusoe  <eos>
<sos> how could you possibly do so  <eos>
<sos> poor dignam  his last lie on the earth in his box  when you think of <eos>
<sos> them all it does seem a waste of wood  all gnawed through  they could <eos>
<sos> invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding  let it down that <eos>
<sos> way  ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow is  <eos>
<sos> they re so particular  lay me in my native earth  bit of clay from the <eos>
<sos> holy land  only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one <eos>
<sos> coffin  i see what it means  i see  to protect him as long as possible <eos>
<sos> even in the earth  the irishman is house is his coffin  embalming in <eos>
<sos> catacombs  mummies the same idea  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom stood far back  his hat in his hand  counting the bared heads  <eos>
<sos> twelve  i am thirteen  no  the chap in the macintosh is thirteen  <eos>
<sos> death is number  where the deuce did he pop out of  he was not in the <eos>
<sos> chapel  that i ll swear  silly superstition that about thirteen  <eos>
<sos> nice soft tweed ned lambert has in that suit  tinge of purple  i had <eos>
<sos> one like that when we lived in lombard street west  dressy fellow he <eos>
<sos> was once  used to change three suits in the day  must get that grey <eos>
<sos> suit of mine turned by mesias  hello  it is dyed  his wife i forgot he is <eos>
<sos> not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for <eos>
<sos> him  <eos>
<sos> the coffin dived out of sight  eased down by the men straddled on the <eos>
<sos> gravetrestles  they struggled up and out  and all uncovered  twenty  <eos>
<sos> pause  <eos>
<sos> if we were all suddenly somebody else  <eos>
<sos> far away a donkey brayed  rain  no such ass  never see a dead one  they <eos>
<sos> say  shame of death  they hide  also poor papa went away  <eos>
<sos> gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper  whisper  the <eos>
<sos> boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in <eos>
<sos> the black open space  mr bloom moved behind the portly kindly <eos>
<sos> caretaker  wellcut frockcoat  weighing them up perhaps to see which <eos>
<sos> will go next  well  it is a long rest  feel no more  it is the moment <eos>
<sos> you feel  must be damned unpleasant  ca not believe it at first  mistake <eos>
<sos> must be  someone else  try the house opposite  wait  i wanted to  i <eos>
<sos> have not yet  then darkened deathchamber  light they want  whispering <eos>
<sos> around you  would you like to see a priest  then rambling and <eos>
<sos> wandering  delirium all you hid all your life  the death struggle  his <eos>
<sos> sleep is not natural  press his lower eyelid  watching is his nose <eos>
<sos> pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow  pull the <eos>
<sos> pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he is doomed  devil in <eos>
<sos> that picture of sinner is death showing him a woman  dying to embrace <eos>
<sos> her in his shirt  last act of lucia  shall i nevermore behold thee  <eos>
<sos> bam  he expires  gone at last  people talk about you a bit  forget you  <eos>
<sos> do not forget to pray for him  remember him in your prayers  even <eos>
<sos> parnell  ivy day dying out  then they follow  dropping into a hole  one <eos>
<sos> after the other  <eos>
<sos> we are praying now for the repose of his soul  hoping you re well and <eos>
<sos> not in hell  nice change of air  out of the fryingpan of life into the <eos>
<sos> fire of purgatory  <eos>
<sos> does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself  they say you do <eos>
<sos> when you shiver in the sun  someone walking over it  callboy is warning  <eos>
<sos> near you  mine over there towards finglas  the plot i bought  mamma  <eos>
<sos> poor mamma  and little rudy  <eos>
<sos> the gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in <eos>
<sos> on the coffin  mr bloom turned away his face  and if he was alive all <eos>
<sos> the time  whew  by jingo  that would be awful  no  no  he is dead  of <eos>
<sos> course  of course he is dead  monday he died  they ought to have some <eos>
<sos> law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a <eos>
<sos> telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole  flag of <eos>
<sos> distress  three days  rather long to keep them in summer  just as well <eos>
<sos> to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there is no  <eos>
<sos> the clay fell softer  begin to be forgotten  out of sight  out of mind  <eos>
<sos> the caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat  had enough of <eos>
<sos> it  the mourners took heart of grace  one by one  covering themselves <eos>
<sos> without show  mr bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make <eos>
<sos> its way deftly through the maze of graves  quietly  sure of his ground  <eos>
<sos> he traversed the dismal fields  <eos>
<sos> hynes jotting down something in his notebook  ah  the names  but he <eos>
<sos> knows them all  no  coming to me  <eos>
<sos>  i am just taking the names  hynes said below his breath  what is your <eos>

<sos> did not hear  what  where has he disappeared to  not a sign  well of all <eos>
<sos> the  has anybody here seen  kay ee double ell  become invisible  good <eos>
<sos> lord  what became of him  <eos>
<sos> a seventh gravedigger came beside mr bloom to take up an idle spade  <eos>
<sos>  o  excuse me  <eos>
<sos> he stepped aside nimbly  <eos>
<sos> clay  brown  damp  began to be seen in the hole  it rose  nearly over  <eos>
<sos> a mound of damp clods rose more  rose  and the gravediggers rested <eos>
<sos> their spades  all uncovered again for a few instants  the boy propped <eos>
<sos> his wreath against a corner  the brother in law his on a lump  the <eos>
<sos> gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards <eos>
<sos> the barrow  then knocked the blades lightly on the turf  clean  one <eos>
<sos> bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass  one  leaving his <eos>
<sos> mates  walked slowly on with shouldered weapon  its blade blueglancing  <eos>
<sos> silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband  his navelcord  <eos>
<sos> the brother in law  turning away  placed something in his free hand  <eos>
<sos> thanks in silence  sorry  sir  trouble  headshake  i know that  for <eos>
<sos> yourselves just  <eos>
<sos> the mourners moved away slowly without aim  by devious paths  staying <eos>
<sos> at whiles to read a name on a tomb  <eos>
<sos>  let us go round by the chief is grave  hynes said  we have time  <eos>
<sos>  let us  mr power said  <eos>
<sos> they turned to the right  following their slow thoughts  with awe mr <eos>
<sos> power is blank voice spoke  <eos>
<sos>  some say he is not in that grave at all  that the coffin was filled <eos>
<sos> with stones  that one day he will come again  <eos>
<sos> hynes shook his head  <eos>
<sos>  parnell will never come again  he said  he is there  all that was <eos>
<sos> mortal of him  peace to his ashes  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels  crosses  <eos>
<sos> broken pillars  family vaults  stone hopes praying with upcast eyes  <eos>
<sos> old ireland is hearts and hands  more sensible to spend the money on <eos>
<sos> some charity for the living  pray for the repose of the soul of  does <eos>
<sos> anybody really  plant him and have done with him  like down a <eos>
<sos> coalshoot  then lump them together to save time  all souls  day  <eos>
<sos> twentyseventh i ll be at his grave  ten shillings for the gardener  he <eos>
<sos> keeps it free of weeds  old man himself  bent down double with his <eos>
<sos> shears clipping  near death is door  who passed away  who departed this <eos>
<sos> life  as if they did it of their own accord  got the shove  all of <eos>
<sos> them  who kicked the bucket  more interesting if they told you what <eos>
<sos> they were  so and so  wheelwright  i travelled for cork lino  i paid <eos>
<sos> five shillings in the pound  or a woman is with her saucepan  i cooked <eos>
<sos> good irish stew  eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that <eos>
<sos> poem of whose is it wordsworth or thomas campbell  entered into rest <eos>
<sos> the protestants put it  old dr murren is  the great physician called him <eos>
<sos> home  well it is god is acre for them  nice country residence  newly <eos>
<sos> plastered and painted  ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the <eos>
<sos> church times  marriage ads they never try to beautify  rusty wreaths <eos>
<sos> hung on knobs  garlands of bronzefoil  better value that for the money  <eos>
<sos> still  the flowers are more poetical  the other gets rather tiresome  <eos>
<sos> never withering  expresses nothing  immortelles  <eos>
<sos> a bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch  like stuffed  like the <eos>
<sos> wedding present alderman hooper gave us  hoo  not a budge out of him  <eos>
<sos> knows there are no catapults to let fly at him  dead animal even <eos>
<sos> sadder  silly milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen <eos>
<sos> matchbox  a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave  <eos>
<sos> the sacred heart that is  showing it  heart on his sleeve  ought to be <eos>
<sos> sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart  ireland was <eos>

<sos> the foreman  without answering  scribbled press on a corner of the <eos>
<sos> sheet and made a sign to a typesetter  he handed the sheet silently <eos>
<sos> over the dirty glass screen  <eos>
<sos>  right  thanks  hynes said moving off  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom stood in his way  <eos>

<sos>  but wait  mr bloom said  he wants it changed  keyes  you see  he wants <eos>
<sos> two keys at the top  <eos>
<sos> hell of a racket they make  he does not hear it  nannan  iron nerves  <eos>
<sos> maybe he understands what i  <eos>
<sos> the foreman turned round to hear patiently and  lifting an elbow  began <eos>
<sos> to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket  <eos>
<sos>  like that  mr bloom said  crossing his forefingers at the top  <eos>
<sos> let him take that in first  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom  glancing sideways up from the cross he had made  saw the <eos>
<sos> foreman is sallow face  think he has a touch of jaundice  and beyond the <eos>

<sos> of it unreeled  what becomes of it after  o  wrap up meat  parcels  <eos>
<sos> various uses  thousand and one things  <eos>
<sos> slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew <eos>
<sos> swiftly on the scarred woodwork  <eos>
<sos> house of key e s <eos>
<sos>  like that  see  two crossed keys here  a circle  then here the name  <eos>

<sos> in leaded  the house of keys  you see  do you think that is a good idea  <eos>
<sos> the foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched <eos>
<sos> there quietly  <eos>
<sos>  the idea  mr bloom said  is the house of keys  you know  councillor  <eos>
<sos> the manx parliament  innuendo of home rule  tourists  you know  from <eos>
<sos> the isle of man  catches the eye  you see  can you do that  <eos>

<sos> and just a little par calling attention  you know the usual  highclass <eos>
<sos> licensed premises  longfelt want  so on  <eos>
<sos> the foreman thought for an instant  <eos>
<sos>  we can do that  he said  let him give us a three months  renewal  <eos>
<sos> a typesetter brought him a limp galleypage  he began to check it <eos>
<sos> silently  mr bloom stood by  hearing the loud throbs of cranks  <eos>
<sos> watching the silent typesetters at their cases  <eos>
<sos> orthographical <eos>
<sos> want to be sure of his spelling  proof fever  martin cunningham forgot <eos>
<sos> to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning  it is amusing to <eos>

<sos> noted churchman an occasional contributor <eos>
<sos> the foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly  saying  <eos>
<sos>  wait  where is the archbishop is letter  it is to be repeated in the <eos>
<sos> telegraph  where is what is his name  <eos>
<sos> he looked about him round his loud unanswering machines  <eos>

<sos> parlour  plain jane  no damn nonsense  <eos>
<sos> and it was the feast of the passover <eos>
<sos> he stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type  <eos>
<sos> reads it backwards first  quickly he does it  must require some <eos>
<sos> practice that  mangid kcirtap  poor papa with his hagadah book  reading <eos>
<sos> backwards with his finger to me  pessach  next year in jerusalem  dear  <eos>

<sos> and then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water <eos>
<sos> and the butcher  and then the angel of death kills the butcher and he <eos>
<sos> kills the ox and the dog kills the cat  sounds a bit silly till you <eos>
<sos> come to look into it well  justice it means but it is everybody eating <eos>
<sos> everyone else  that is what life is after all  how quickly he does that <eos>
<sos> job  practice makes perfect  seems to see with his fingers  <eos>

<sos> the fireplace and to the window  and marathon looked on the sea  <eos>
<sos>  that will do  professor machugh cried from the window  i do not want to <eos>
<sos> hear any more of the stuff  <eos>
<sos> he ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and  <eos>
<sos> hungered  made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand  <eos>
<sos> high falutin stuff  bladderbags  ned lambert is taking a day off i see  <eos>
<sos> rather upsets a man is day  a funeral does  he has influence they say  <eos>

<sos>  just another spasm  ned lambert said  <eos>
<sos>  what is it  mr bloom asked  <eos>
<sos>  a recently discovered fragment of cicero  professor machugh answered <eos>
<sos> with pomp of tone  our lovely land  <eos>
<sos> short but to the point <eos>
<sos>  whose land  mr bloom said simply  <eos>
<sos>  most pertinent question  the professor said between his chews  with an <eos>
<sos> accent on the whose  <eos>
<sos>  dan dawson is land mr dedalus said  <eos>
<sos>  is it his speech last night  mr bloom asked  <eos>
<sos> ned lambert nodded  <eos>
<sos>  but listen to this  he said  <eos>
<sos> the doorknob hit mr bloom in the small of the back as the door was <eos>
<sos> pushed in  <eos>
<sos>  excuse me  j  j  o molloy said  entering  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom moved nimbly aside  <eos>
<sos>  i beg yours  he said  <eos>

<sos>  good day  <eos>
<sos>  how are you  dedalus  <eos>
<sos>  well  and yourself  <eos>

<sos>  or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks  <eos>
<sos>  you re looking extra  <eos>

<sos> inner door  <eos>
<sos>  very much so  professor machugh said  to be seen and heard  he is in <eos>
<sos> his sanctum with lenehan  <eos>
<sos> j  j  o molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the <eos>
<sos> pink pages of the file  <eos>

<sos> all blows over  hail fellow well met the next moment  <eos>
<sos>  ah  listen to this for god  sake  ned lambert pleaded  _or again if we <eos>
<sos> but climb the serried mountain peaks   _ <eos>
<sos>  bombast  the professor broke in testily  enough of the inflated <eos>
<sos> windbag  <eos>
<sos>  peaks  ned lambert went on  _towering high on high  to bathe our <eos>
<sos> souls  as it were   _ <eos>
<sos>  bathe his lips  mr dedalus said  blessed and eternal god  yes  is he <eos>
<sos> taking anything for it  <eos>

<sos> he took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and  breaking <eos>
<sos> off a piece  twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant <eos>
<sos> unwashed teeth  <eos>
<sos>  bingbang  bangbang  <eos>

<sos> screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was <eos>
<sos> flung open  <eos>
<sos>  hush  lenehan said  i hear feetstoops  <eos>
<sos> professor machugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin <eos>
<sos> by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the <eos>
<sos> steps  the tissues rustled up in the draught  floated softly in the air <eos>
<sos> blue scrawls and under the table came to earth  <eos>
<sos>  it was not me  sir  it was the big fellow shoved me  sir  <eos>
<sos>  throw him out and shut the door  the editor said  there is a hurricane <eos>
<sos> blowing  <eos>

<sos> stooped twice  <eos>
<sos>  waiting for the racing special  sir  the newsboy said  it was pat <eos>
<sos> farrell shoved me  sir  <eos>
<sos> he pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe  <eos>
<sos>  him  sir  <eos>

<sos> the bell whirred again as he rang off  he came in quickly and bumped <eos>
<sos> against lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue  <eos>
<sos>  pardon  monsieur  lenehan said  clutching him for an instant and <eos>
<sos> making a grimace  <eos>
<sos>  my fault  mr bloom said  suffering his grip  are you hurt  i am in a <eos>
<sos> hurry  <eos>

<sos> he made a comic face and whined  rubbing his knee  <eos>
<sos>  the accumulation of the anno domini  <eos>
<sos>  sorry  mr bloom said  <eos>
<sos> he went to the door and  holding it ajar  paused  j  j  o molloy <eos>
<sos> slapped the heavy pages over  the noise of two shrill voices  a <eos>
<sos> mouthorgan  echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on <eos>
<sos> the doorsteps  <eos>
<sos> we are the boys of wexford <eos>
<sos> who fought with heart and hand  <eos>
<sos> exit bloom <eos>
<sos>  i am just running round to bachelor is walk  mr bloom said  about this <eos>
<sos> ad of keyes is  want to fix it up  they tell me he is round there in <eos>
<sos> dillon is  <eos>
<sos> he looked indecisively for a moment at their faces  the editor who  <eos>
<sos> leaning against the mantelshelf  had propped his head on his hand  <eos>
<sos> suddenly stretched forth an arm amply  <eos>
<sos>  begone  he said  the world is before you  <eos>
<sos>  back in no time  mr bloom said  hurrying out  <eos>
<sos> j  j  o molloy took the tissues from lenehan is hand and read them  <eos>
<sos> blowing them apart gently  without comment  <eos>
<sos>  he ll get that advertisement  the professor said  staring through his <eos>
<sos> blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind  look at the young scamps <eos>
<sos> after him  <eos>
<sos>  show  where  lenehan cried  running to the window  <eos>
<sos> a street cortège <eos>
<sos> both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in mr <eos>
<sos> bloom is wake  the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite  a <eos>
<sos> tail of white bowknots  <eos>
<sos>  look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry  lenehan said  <eos>
<sos> and you ll kick  o  my rib risible  taking off his flat spaugs and the <eos>
<sos> walk  small nines  steal upon larks  <eos>
<sos> he began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding <eos>
<sos> feet past the fireplace to j  j  o molloy who placed the tissues in his <eos>
<sos> receiving hands  <eos>
<sos>  what is that  myles crawford said with a start  where are the other two <eos>

<sos> drink  paddy hooper is there with jack hall  came over last night  <eos>
<sos>  come on then  myles crawford said  where is my hat  <eos>
<sos> he walked jerkily into the office behind  parting the vent of his <eos>
<sos> jacket  jingling his keys in his back pocket  they jingled then in the <eos>
<sos> air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer  <eos>
<sos>  he is pretty well on  professor machugh said in a low voice  <eos>
<sos>  seems to be  j  j  o molloy said  taking out a cigarettecase in <eos>
<sos> murmuring meditation  but it is not always as it seems  who has the <eos>
<sos> most matches  <eos>
<sos> the calumet of peace <eos>
<sos> he offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself  lenehan <eos>
<sos> promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn  j  <eos>
<sos> j  o molloy opened his case again and offered it  <eos>
<sos>  thanky vous  lenehan said  helping himself  <eos>
<sos> the editor came from the inner office  a straw hat awry on his brow  he <eos>
<sos> declaimed in song  pointing sternly at professor machugh  <eos>
<sos>  twas rank and fame that tempted thee  <eos>
<sos>  twas empire charmed thy heart  <eos>
<sos> the professor grinned  locking his long lips  <eos>
<sos>  eh  you bloody old roman empire  myles crawford said  <eos>
<sos> he took a cigarette from the open case  lenehan  lighting it for him <eos>
<sos> with quick grace  said  <eos>
<sos>  silence for my brandnew riddle  <eos>
<sos>  imperium romanum  j  j  o molloy said gently  it sounds nobler than <eos>
<sos> british or brixton  the word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire  <eos>
<sos> myles crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling  <eos>
<sos>  that is it  he said  we are the fat  you and i are the fat in the fire  <eos>
<sos> we have not got the chance of a snowball in hell  <eos>
<sos> the grandeur that was rome <eos>
<sos>  wait a moment  professor machugh said  raising two quiet claws  we <eos>
<sos> must not be led away by words  by sounds of words  we think of rome  <eos>
<sos> imperial  imperious  imperative  <eos>
<sos> he extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs  pausing  <eos>
<sos>  what was their civilisation  vast  i allow  but vile  cloacae  sewers  <eos>
<sos> the jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said  _it is meet to <eos>
<sos> be here  let us build an altar to jehovah_  the roman  like the <eos>
<sos> englishman who follows in his footsteps  brought to every new shore on <eos>
<sos> which he set his foot  on our shore he never set it  only his cloacal <eos>
<sos> obsession  he gazed about him in his toga and he said  _it is meet to <eos>
<sos> be here  let us construct a watercloset _ <eos>
<sos>  which they accordingly did do  lenehan said  our old ancient <eos>
<sos> ancestors  as we read in the first chapter of guinness is  were partial <eos>
<sos> to the running stream  <eos>
<sos>  they were nature is gentlemen  j  j  o molloy murmured  but we have <eos>
<sos> also roman law  <eos>

<sos>  they went forth to battle  mr o madden burke said greyly  but they <eos>
<sos> always fell  <eos>
<sos>  boohoo  lenehan wept with a little noise  owing to a brick received in <eos>
<sos> the latter half of the matinée  poor  poor  poor pyrrhus  <eos>
<sos> he whispered then near stephen is ear  <eos>

<sos> and edmund burke  ignatius gallaher we all know and his chapelizod <eos>
<sos> boss  harmsworth of the farthing press  and his american cousin of the <eos>
<sos> bowery guttersheet not to mention paddy kelly is budget  _pue is <eos>

<sos> day is the newspaper thereof  <eos>
<sos> links with bygone days of yore <eos>
<sos>  grattan and flood wrote for this very paper  the editor cried in his <eos>
<sos> face  irish volunteers  where are you now  established 1763  dr lucas  <eos>
<sos> who have you now like john philpot curran  psha  <eos>
<sos>  well  j  j  o molloy said  bushe k c   for example  <eos>
<sos>  bushe  the editor said  well  yes  bushe  yes  he has a strain of it <eos>
<sos> in his blood  kendal bushe or i mean seymour bushe  <eos>
<sos>  he would have been on the bench long ago  the professor said  only for <eos>
<sos>      but no matter  <eos>
<sos> j  j  o molloy turned to stephen and said quietly and slowly  <eos>
<sos>  one of the most polished periods i think i ever listened to in my life <eos>
<sos> fell from the lips of seymour bushe  it was in that case of fratricide  <eos>
<sos> the childs murder case  bushe defended him  <eos>
<sos> and in the porches of mine ear did pour  <eos>
<sos> by the way how did he find that out  he died in his sleep  or the other <eos>
<sos> story  beast with two backs  <eos>
<sos>  what was that  the professor asked  <eos>
<sos> italia  magistra artium <eos>
<sos>  he spoke on the law of evidence  j  j  o molloy said  of roman justice <eos>
<sos> as contrasted with the earlier mosaic code  the lex talionis  and he <eos>
<sos> cited the moses of michelangelo in the vatican  <eos>
<sos>  ha  <eos>
<sos>  a few wellchosen words  lenehan prefaced  silence  <eos>
<sos> pause  j  j  o molloy took out his cigarettecase  <eos>
<sos> false lull  something quite ordinary  <eos>
<sos> messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar  <eos>
<sos> i have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that <eos>
<sos> it was that small act  trivial in itself  that striking of that match  <eos>
<sos> that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives  <eos>
<sos> a polished period <eos>
<sos> j  j  o molloy resumed  moulding his words  <eos>
<sos>  he said of it  _that stony effigy in frozen music  horned and <eos>
<sos> terrible  of the human form divine  that eternal symbol of wisdom and <eos>
<sos> of prophecy which  if aught that the imagination or the hand of <eos>
<sos> sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of <eos>
<sos> soultransfiguring deserves to live  deserves to live _ <eos>
<sos> his slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall  <eos>
<sos>  fine  myles crawford said at once  <eos>
<sos>  the divine afflatus  mr o madden burke said  <eos>
<sos>  you like it  j  j  o molloy asked stephen  <eos>
<sos> stephen  his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture  blushed  he <eos>
<sos> took a cigarette from the case  j  j  o molloy offered his case to <eos>
<sos> myles crawford  lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his <eos>
<sos> trophy  saying  <eos>
<sos>  muchibus thankibus  <eos>
<sos> a man of high morale <eos>
<sos>  professor magennis was speaking to me about you  j  j  o molloy said <eos>
<sos> to stephen  what do you think really of that hermetic crowd  the opal <eos>
<sos> hush poets  a  e  the mastermystic  that blavatsky woman started it  <eos>
<sos> she was a nice old bag of tricks  a  e  has been telling some yankee <eos>
<sos> interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to <eos>
<sos> ask him about planes of consciousness  magennis thinks you must have <eos>
<sos> been pulling a  e  s leg  he is a man of the very highest morale  <eos>
<sos> magennis  <eos>
<sos> speaking about me  what did he say  what did he say  what did he say <eos>
<sos> about me  do not ask  <eos>
<sos>  no  thanks  professor machugh said  waving the cigarettecase aside  <eos>
<sos> wait a moment  let me say one thing  the finest display of oratory i <eos>
<sos> ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical <eos>
<sos> society  mr justice fitzgibbon  the present lord justice of appeal  had <eos>
<sos> spoken and the paper under debate was an essay  new for those days   <eos>
<sos> advocating the revival of the irish tongue  <eos>
<sos> he turned towards myles crawford and said  <eos>
<sos>  you know gerald fitzgibbon  then you can imagine the style of his <eos>
<sos> discourse  <eos>
<sos>  he is sitting with tim healy  j  j  o molloy said  rumour has it  on <eos>
<sos> the trinity college estates commission  <eos>
<sos>  he is sitting with a sweet thing  myles crawford said  in a child is <eos>
<sos> frock  go on  well  <eos>
<sos>  it was the speech  mark you  the professor said  of a finished orator  <eos>
<sos> full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will <eos>
<sos> not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man is contumely <eos>
<sos> upon the new movement  it was then a new movement  we were weak  <eos>
<sos> therefore worthless  <eos>
<sos> he closed his long thin lips an instant but  eager to be on  raised an <eos>
<sos> outspanned hand to his spectacles and  with trembling thumb and <eos>
<sos> ringfinger touching lightly the black rims  steadied them to a new <eos>
<sos> focus  <eos>
<sos> impromptu <eos>
<sos> in ferial tone he addressed j  j  o molloy  <eos>
<sos>  taylor had come there  you must know  from a sickbed  that he had <eos>
<sos> prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one <eos>
<sos> shorthandwriter in the hall  his dark lean face had a growth of shaggy <eos>
<sos> beard round it  he wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he <eos>
<sos> looked  though he was not  a dying man  <eos>
<sos> his gaze turned at once but slowly from j  j  o molloy is towards <eos>
<sos> stephen is face and then bent at once to the ground  seeking  his <eos>
<sos> unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head  soiled by his <eos>
<sos> withering hair  still seeking  he said  <eos>
<sos>  when fitzgibbon is speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply  <eos>
<sos> briefly  as well as i can bring them to mind  his words were these  <eos>
<sos> he raised his head firmly  his eyes bethought themselves once more  <eos>
<sos> witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro  seeking outlet  <eos>
<sos> he began  <eos>
<sos> _ mr chairman  ladies and gentlemen  great was my admiration in <eos>
<sos> listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment <eos>
<sos> since by my learned friend  it seemed to me that i had been transported <eos>
<sos> into a country far away from this country  into an age remote from this <eos>
<sos> age  that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the <eos>
<sos> speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful <eos>
<sos> moses _ <eos>
<sos> his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear  their smokes <eos>
<sos> ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech  _and let our <eos>
<sos> crooked smokes _ noble words coming  look out  could you try your hand <eos>
<sos> at it yourself  <eos>
<sos> _ and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian <eos>
<sos> highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride  i heard <eos>
<sos> his words and their meaning was revealed to me _ <eos>
<sos> from the fathers <eos>
<sos> it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are <eos>
<sos> corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they <eos>
<sos> were good could be corrupted  ah  curse you  that is saint augustine  <eos>
<sos> _ why will you jews not accept our culture  our religion and our <eos>
<sos> language  you are a tribe of nomad herdsmen  we are a mighty people  <eos>
<sos> you have no cities nor no wealth  our cities are hives of humanity and <eos>
<sos> our galleys  trireme and quadrireme  laden with all manner merchandise <eos>
<sos> furrow the waters of the known globe  you have but emerged from <eos>
<sos> primitive conditions  we have a literature  a priesthood  an agelong <eos>
<sos> history and a polity _ <eos>
<sos> nile  <eos>
<sos> child  man  effigy  <eos>
<sos> by the nilebank the babemaries kneel  cradle of bulrushes  a man supple <eos>
<sos> in combat  stonehorned  stonebearded  heart of stone  <eos>
<sos> _ you pray to a local and obscure idol  our temples  majestic and <eos>
<sos> mysterious  are the abodes of isis and osiris  of horus and ammon ra  <eos>
<sos> yours serfdom  awe and humbleness  ours thunder and the seas  israel is <eos>
<sos> weak and few are her children  egypt is an host and terrible are her <eos>
<sos> arms  vagrants and daylabourers are you called  the world trembles at <eos>
<sos> our name _ <eos>
<sos> a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech  he lifted his voice above it <eos>
<sos> boldly  <eos>
<sos> _ but  ladies and gentlemen  had the youthful moses listened to and <eos>
<sos> accepted that view of life  had he bowed his head and bowed his will <eos>
<sos> and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never <eos>
<sos> have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage  nor <eos>
<sos> followed the pillar of the cloud by day  he would never have spoken <eos>
<sos> with the eternal amid lightnings on sinai is mountaintop nor ever have <eos>
<sos> come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and <eos>
<sos> bearing in his arms the tables of the law  graven in the language of <eos>
<sos> the outlaw _ <eos>
<sos> he ceased and looked at them  enjoying a silence  <eos>
<sos> ominous for him  <eos>
<sos> j  j  o molloy said not without regret  <eos>
<sos>  and yet he died without having entered the land of promise  <eos>
<sos>  a sudden at the moment though from lingering illness often previously  <eos>
<sos> expectorated demise  lenehan added  and with a great future behind him  <eos>
<sos> the troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and <eos>
<sos> pattering up the staircase  <eos>
<sos>  that is oratory  the professor said uncontradicted  <eos>
<sos> gone with the wind  hosts at mullaghmast and tara of the kings  miles <eos>
<sos> of ears of porches  the tribune is words  howled and scattered to the <eos>
<sos> four winds  a people sheltered within his voice  dead noise  akasic <eos>

<sos> no more  <eos>
<sos> i have money  <eos>
<sos>  gentlemen  stephen said  as the next motion on the agenda paper may i <eos>
<sos> suggest that the house do now adjourn  <eos>
<sos>  you take my breath away  it is not perchance a french compliment  mr <eos>
<sos> o madden burke asked   tis the hour  methinks  when the winejug  <eos>
<sos> metaphorically speaking  is most grateful in ye ancient hostelry  <eos>
<sos>  that it be and hereby is resolutely resolved  all that are in favour <eos>
<sos> say ay  lenehan announced  the contrary no  i declare it carried  to <eos>
<sos> which particular boosing shed     my casting vote is  mooney is  <eos>
<sos> he led the way  admonishing  <eos>
<sos>  we will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters  will we not  yes  <eos>
<sos> we will not  by no manner of means  <eos>
<sos> mr o madden burke  following close  said with an ally is lunge of his <eos>

<sos>  lay on  macduff  <eos>
<sos>  chip of the old block  the editor cried  clapping stephen on the <eos>
<sos> shoulder  let us go  where are those blasted keys  <eos>
<sos> he fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets  <eos>
<sos>  foot and mouth  i know  that ll be all right  that ll go in  where are <eos>
<sos> they  that is all right  <eos>
<sos> he thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office  <eos>
<sos> let us hope <eos>
<sos> j  j  o molloy  about to follow him in  said quietly to stephen  <eos>
<sos>  i hope you will live to see it published  myles  one moment  <eos>
<sos> he went into the inner office  closing the door behind him  <eos>
<sos>  come along  stephen  the professor said  that is fine  is not it  it <eos>
<sos> has the prophetic vision  fuit ilium  the sack of windy troy  <eos>
<sos> kingdoms of this world  the masters of the mediterranean are fellaheen <eos>

<sos> they turned to the left along abbey street  <eos>
<sos>  i have a vision too  stephen said  <eos>

<sos> follow  <eos>
<sos> another newsboy shot past them  yelling as he ran  <eos>

<sos> a girl at the foot of nelson is pillar to take off the thirst of the <eos>

<sos> encouraging each other  afraid of the dark  panting  one asking the <eos>

<sos>  antithesis  the professor said nodding twice  vestal virgins  i can <eos>
<sos> see them  what is keeping our friend  <eos>
<sos> he turned  <eos>
<sos> a bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps  scattering in all <eos>
<sos> directions  yelling  their white papers fluttering  hard after them <eos>
<sos> myles crawford appeared on the steps  his hat aureoling his scarlet <eos>
<sos> face  talking with j  j  o molloy  <eos>
<sos>  come along  the professor cried  waving his arm  <eos>
<sos> he set off again to walk by stephen is side  <eos>

<sos> while mr bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on <eos>
<sos> jerkily  <eos>
<sos> raising the wind <eos>

<sos> wind anyhow  <eos>
<sos> j  j  o molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently  they caught <eos>
<sos> up on the others and walked abreast  <eos>
<sos>  when they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty <eos>
<sos> fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the <eos>
<sos> railings  <eos>

<sos> blue dome  adam and eve is  saint laurence o toole is  but it makes them <eos>
<sos> giddy to look so they pull up their skirts    <eos>
<sos> those slightly rambunctious females <eos>
<sos>  easy all  myles crawford said  no poetic licence  we re in the <eos>
<sos> archdiocese here  <eos>
<sos>  and settle down on their striped petticoats  peering up at the statue <eos>
<sos> of the onehandled adulterer  <eos>

<sos> idea  i see what you mean  <eos>

<sos>  it gives them a crick in their necks  stephen said  and they are too <eos>
<sos> tired to look up or down or to speak  they put the bag of plums between <eos>
<sos> them and eat the plums out of it  one after another  wiping off with <eos>
<sos> their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and <eos>
<sos> spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings  <eos>
<sos> he gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close  lenehan and mr o madden <eos>
<sos> burke  hearing  turned  beckoned and led on across towards mooney is  <eos>
<sos>  finished  myles crawford said  so long as they do no worse  <eos>

<sos>  you remind me of antisthenes  the professor said  a disciple of <eos>
<sos> gorgias  the sophist  it is said of him that none could tell if he were <eos>
<sos> bitterer against others or against himself  he was the son of a noble <eos>
<sos> and a bondwoman  and he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of <eos>
<sos> beauty from argive helen and handed it to poor penelope  <eos>

<sos> passed the reverend thomas connellan is bookstore  _why i left the <eos>
<sos> church of rome  birds  nest _ women run him  they say they used to give <eos>
<sos> pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato <eos>
<sos> blight  society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor <eos>
<sos> jews  same bait  why we left the church of rome  <eos>
<sos> a blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane  no <eos>
<sos> tram in sight  wants to cross  <eos>
<sos>  do you want to cross  mr bloom asked  <eos>
<sos> the blind stripling did not answer  his wallface frowned weakly  he <eos>
<sos> moved his head uncertainly  <eos>
<sos>  you re in dawson street  mr bloom said  molesworth street is opposite  <eos>
<sos> do you want to cross  there is nothing in the way  <eos>
<sos> the cane moved out trembling to the left  mr bloom is eye followed its <eos>
<sos> line and saw again the dyeworks  van drawn up before drago is  where i <eos>
<sos> saw his brillantined hair just when i was  horse drooping  driver in <eos>
<sos> john long is  slaking his drouth  <eos>
<sos>  there is a van there  mr bloom said  but it is not moving  i ll see you <eos>
<sos> across  do you want to go to molesworth street  <eos>
<sos>  yes  the stripling answered  south frederick street  <eos>
<sos>  come  mr bloom said  <eos>
<sos> he touched the thin elbow gently  then took the limp seeing hand to <eos>
<sos> guide it forward  <eos>
<sos> say something to him  better not do the condescending  they mistrust <eos>
<sos> what you tell them  pass a common remark  <eos>
<sos>  the rain kept off  <eos>

<sos> horse  <eos>
<sos>  thanks  sir  <eos>
<sos> knows i am a man  voice  <eos>
<sos>  right now  first turn to the left  <eos>
<sos> the blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way  drawing <eos>
<sos> his cane back  feeling again  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom walked behind the eyeless feet  a flatcut suit of herringbone <eos>
<sos> tweed  poor young fellow  how on earth did he know that van was there  <eos>
<sos> must have felt it  see things in their forehead perhaps  kind of sense <eos>
<sos> of volume  weight or size of it  something blacker than the dark  <eos>
<sos> wonder would he feel it if something was removed  feel a gap  queer <eos>
<sos> idea of dublin he must have  tapping his way round by the stones  could <eos>
<sos> he walk in a beeline if he had not that cane  bloodless pious face like <eos>
<sos> a fellow going in to be a priest  <eos>
<sos> penrose  that was that chap is name  <eos>
<sos> look at all the things they can learn to do  read with their fingers  <eos>
<sos> tune pianos  or we are surprised they have any brains  why we think a <eos>
<sos> deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might <eos>
<sos> say  of course the other senses are more  embroider  plait baskets  <eos>
<sos> people ought to help  workbasket i could buy for molly is birthday  <eos>
<sos> hates sewing  might take an objection  dark men they call them  <eos>
<sos> sense of smell must be stronger too  smells on all sides  bunched <eos>
<sos> together  each street different smell  each person too  then the <eos>
<sos> spring  the summer  smells  tastes  they say you ca not taste wines with <eos>
<sos> your eyes shut or a cold in the head  also smoke in the dark they say <eos>
<sos> get no pleasure  <eos>
<sos> and with a woman  for instance  more shameless not seeing  that girl <eos>
<sos> passing the stewart institution  head in the air  look at me  i have <eos>
<sos> them all on  must be strange not to see her  kind of a form in his <eos>
<sos> mind is eye  the voice  temperatures  when he touches her with his <eos>
<sos> fingers must almost see the lines  the curves  his hands on her hair  <eos>
<sos> for instance  say it was black  for instance  good  we call it black  <eos>
<sos> then passing over her white skin  different feel perhaps  feeling of <eos>
<sos> white  <eos>
<sos> postoffice  must answer  fag today  send her a postal order two <eos>
<sos> shillings  half a crown  accept my little present  stationer is just <eos>
<sos> here too  wait  think over it  <eos>
<sos> with a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above <eos>
<sos> his ears  again  fibres of fine fine straw  then gently his finger felt <eos>
<sos> the skin of his right cheek  downy hair there too  not smooth enough  <eos>
<sos> the belly is the smoothest  no one about  there he goes into frederick <eos>
<sos> street  perhaps to levenston is dancing academy piano  might be settling <eos>
<sos> my braces  <eos>
<sos> walking by doran is publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat <eos>
<sos> and trousers and  pulling aside his shirt gently  felt a slack fold of <eos>
<sos> his belly  but i know it is whitey yellow  want to try in the dark to <eos>
<sos> see  <eos>
<sos> he withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to  <eos>
<sos> poor fellow  quite a boy  terrible  really terrible  what dreams would <eos>

<sos> urbane  to comfort them  the quaker librarian purred  <eos>
<sos>  and we have  have we not  those priceless pages of wilhelm meister  <eos>
<sos> a great poet on a great brother poet  a hesitating soul taking arms <eos>
<sos> against a sea of troubles  torn by conflicting doubts  as one sees in <eos>
<sos> real life  <eos>
<sos> he came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step <eos>
<sos> backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor  <eos>
<sos> a noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a <eos>
<sos> noiseless beck  <eos>
<sos>  directly  said he  creaking to go  albeit lingering  the beautiful <eos>
<sos> ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts  one always <eos>
<sos> feels that goethe is judgments are so true  true in the larger analysis  <eos>
<sos> twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off  bald  most zealous by the door <eos>
<sos> he gave his large ear all to the attendant is words  heard them  and was <eos>
<sos> gone  <eos>

<sos> before his death  <eos>

<sos> of satan_ he calls it  <eos>

<sos> first he tickled her <eos>
<sos> then he patted her <eos>
<sos> then he passed the female catheter <eos>
<sos> for he was a medical <eos>

<sos>  our young irish bards  john eglinton censured  have yet to create a <eos>
<sos> figure which the world will set beside saxon shakespeare is hamlet <eos>
<sos> though i admire him  as old ben did  on this side idolatry  <eos>
<sos>  all these questions are purely academic  russell oracled out of his <eos>
<sos> shadow  i mean  whether hamlet is shakespeare or james i or essex  <eos>
<sos> clergymen is discussions of the historicity of jesus  art has to reveal <eos>
<sos> to us ideas  formless spiritual essences  the supreme question about a <eos>
<sos> work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring  the painting of <eos>
<sos> gustave moreau is the painting of ideas  the deepest poetry of shelley  <eos>
<sos> the words of hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal <eos>
<sos> wisdom  plato is world of ideas  all the rest is the speculation of <eos>
<sos> schoolboys for schoolboys  <eos>
<sos> a  e  has been telling some yankee interviewer  wall  tarnation strike <eos>
<sos> me  <eos>
<sos>  the schoolmen were schoolboys first  stephen said superpolitely  <eos>
<sos> aristotle was once plato is schoolboy  <eos>
<sos>  and has remained so  one should hope  john eglinton sedately said  one <eos>
<sos> can see him  a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm  <eos>
<sos> he laughed again at the now smiling bearded face  <eos>
<sos> formless spiritual  father  word and holy breath  allfather  the <eos>
<sos> heavenly man  hiesos kristos  magician of the beautiful  the logos who <eos>
<sos> suffers in us at every moment  this verily is that  i am the fire upon <eos>

<sos> o  fie  out o not  pfuiteufel  you naught not to look  missus  so you <eos>
<sos> naught not when a lady is ashowing of her elemental  <eos>
<sos> mr best entered  tall  young  mild  light  he bore in his hand with <eos>
<sos> grace a notebook  new  large  clean  bright  <eos>
<sos>  that model schoolboy  stephen said  would find hamlet is musings about <eos>
<sos> the afterlife of his princely soul  the improbable  insignificant and <eos>
<sos> undramatic monologue  as shallow as plato is  <eos>
<sos> john eglinton  frowning  said  waxing wroth  <eos>
<sos>  upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare aristotle <eos>
<sos> with plato  <eos>
<sos>  which of the two  stephen asked  would have banished me from his <eos>
<sos> commonwealth  <eos>
<sos> unsheathe your dagger definitions  horseness is the whatness of <eos>
<sos> allhorse  streams of tendency and eons they worship  god  noise in the <eos>
<sos> street  very peripatetic  space  what you damn well have to see  <eos>
<sos> through spaces smaller than red globules of man is blood they <eos>
<sos> creepycrawl after blake is buttocks into eternity of which this <eos>
<sos> vegetable world is but a shadow  hold to the now  the here  through <eos>
<sos> which all future plunges to the past  <eos>
<sos> mr best came forward  amiable  towards his colleague  <eos>
<sos>  haines is gone  he said  <eos>
<sos>  is he  <eos>
<sos>  i was showing him jubainville is book  he is quite enthusiastic  do not <eos>
<sos> you know  about hyde is lovesongs of connacht  i could not bring him in <eos>
<sos> to hear the discussion  he is gone to gill is to buy it  <eos>
<sos> bound thee forth  my booklet  quick <eos>
<sos> to greet the callous public  <eos>
<sos> writ  i ween   twas not my wish <eos>

<sos>  the peatsmoke is going to his head  john eglinton opined  <eos>
<sos> we feel in england  penitent thief  gone  i smoked his baccy  green <eos>
<sos> twinkling stone  an emerald set in the ring of the sea  <eos>
<sos>  people do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be  the auric egg of <eos>
<sos> russell warned occultly  the movements which work revolutions in the <eos>
<sos> world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant is heart on <eos>
<sos> the hillside  for them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the <eos>
<sos> living mother  the rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce <eos>
<sos> the sixshilling novel  the musichall song  france produces the finest <eos>
<sos> flower of corruption in mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed <eos>
<sos> only to the poor of heart  the life of homer is phæacians  <eos>
<sos> from these words mr best turned an unoffending face to stephen  <eos>
<sos>  mallarmé  do not you know  he said  has written those wonderful prose <eos>
<sos> poems stephen mackenna used to read to me in paris  the one about <eos>
<sos> hamlet  he says  il se promène  lisant au livre de lui même  do not <eos>
<sos> you know  reading the book of himself  he describes hamlet given in <eos>
<sos> a french town  do not you know  a provincial town  they advertised it  <eos>
<sos> his free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air  <eos>
<sos> _hamlet <eos>
<sos> ou <eos>
<sos> le distrait <eos>
<sos> pièce de shakespeare_ <eos>
<sos> he repeated to john eglinton is newgathered frown  <eos>
<sos>  pièce de shakespeare  do not you know  it is so french  the french <eos>
<sos> point of view  hamlet ou    <eos>
<sos>  the absentminded beggar  stephen ended  <eos>
<sos> john eglinton laughed  <eos>
<sos>  yes  i suppose it would be  he said  excellent people  no doubt  but <eos>
<sos> distressingly shortsighted in some matters  <eos>
<sos> sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder  <eos>
<sos>  a deathsman of the soul robert greene called him  stephen said  not <eos>
<sos> for nothing was he a butcher is son  wielding the sledded poleaxe and <eos>
<sos> spitting in his palms  nine lives are taken off for his father is one  <eos>
<sos> our father who art in purgatory  khaki hamlets do not hesitate to shoot  <eos>
<sos> the bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the <eos>
<sos> concentration camp sung by mr swinburne  <eos>
<sos> cranly  i his mute orderly  following battles from afar  <eos>
<sos> whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none <eos>
<sos> but we had spared    <eos>
<sos> between the saxon smile and yankee yawp  the devil and the deep sea  <eos>
<sos>  he will have it that hamlet is a ghoststory  john eglinton said for <eos>
<sos> mr best is behoof  like the fat boy in pickwick he wants to make our <eos>
<sos> flesh creep  <eos>
<sos> list  list  o list  <eos>
<sos> my flesh hears him  creeping  hears  <eos>
<sos> if thou didst ever    <eos>
<sos>  what is a ghost  stephen said with tingling energy  one who has faded <eos>
<sos> into impalpability through death  through absence  through change of <eos>
<sos> manners  elizabethan london lay as far from stratford as corrupt paris <eos>
<sos> lies from virgin dublin  who is the ghost from limbo patrum  <eos>
<sos> returning to the world that has forgotten him  who is king hamlet  <eos>
<sos> john eglinton shifted his spare body  leaning back to judge  <eos>
<sos> lifted  <eos>
<sos>  it is this hour of a day in mid june  stephen said  begging with a <eos>
<sos> swift glance their hearing  the flag is up on the playhouse by the <eos>
<sos> bankside  the bear sackerson growls in the pit near it  paris garden  <eos>
<sos> canvasclimbers who sailed with drake chew their sausages among the <eos>
<sos> groundlings  <eos>
<sos> local colour  work in all you know  make them accomplices  <eos>
<sos>  shakespeare has left the huguenot is house in silver street and walks <eos>
<sos> by the swanmews along the riverbank  but he does not stay to feed the <eos>
<sos> pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes  the swan of avon <eos>
<sos> has other thoughts  <eos>
<sos> composition of place  ignatius loyola  make haste to help me  <eos>
<sos>  the play begins  a player comes on under the shadow  made up in the <eos>
<sos> castoff mail of a court buck  a wellset man with a bass voice  it is <eos>
<sos> the ghost  the king  a king and no king  and the player is shakespeare <eos>
<sos> who has studied hamlet all the years of his life which were not <eos>
<sos> vanity in order to play the part of the spectre  he speaks the words to <eos>
<sos> burbage  the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of <eos>
<sos> cerecloth  calling him by a name  <eos>
<sos> hamlet  i am thy father is spirit  <eos>
<sos> bidding him list  to a son he speaks  the son of his soul  the prince  <eos>
<sos> young hamlet and to the son of his body  hamnet shakespeare  who has <eos>
<sos> died in stratford that his namesake may live for ever  <eos>
<sos> is it possible that that player shakespeare  a ghost by absence  and in <eos>
<sos> the vesture of buried denmark  a ghost by death  speaking his own words <eos>
<sos> to his own son is name  had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been <eos>
<sos> prince hamlet is twin   is it possible  i want to know  or probable that <eos>
<sos> he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises  <eos>
<sos> you are the dispossessed son  i am the murdered father  your mother is <eos>
<sos> the guilty queen  ann shakespeare  born hathaway  <eos>
<sos>  but this prying into the family life of a great man  russell began <eos>
<sos> impatiently  <eos>
<sos> art thou there  truepenny  <eos>
<sos>  interesting only to the parish clerk  i mean  we have the plays  i <eos>
<sos> mean when we read the poetry of king lear what is it to us how the <eos>
<sos> poet lived  as for living our servants can do that for us  villiers de <eos>
<sos> l isle has said  peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day  <eos>
<sos> the poet is drinking  the poet is debts  we have king lear  and it is <eos>
<sos> immortal  <eos>
<sos> mr best is face  appealed to  agreed  <eos>

<sos>  do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries  <eos>
<sos> john eglinton is carping voice asked  her ghost at least has been laid <eos>
<sos> for ever  she died  for literature at least  before she was born  <eos>
<sos>  she died  stephen retorted  sixtyseven years after she was born  she <eos>
<sos> saw him into and out of the world  she took his first embraces  she <eos>
<sos> bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids <eos>
<sos> closed when he lay on his deathbed  <eos>
<sos> mother is deathbed  candle  the sheeted mirror  who brought me into this <eos>
<sos> world lies there  bronzelidded  under few cheap flowers  _liliata <eos>
<sos> rutilantium _ <eos>
<sos> i wept alone  <eos>
<sos> john eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp  <eos>
<sos>  the world believes that shakespeare made a mistake  he said  and got <eos>
<sos> out of it as quickly and as best he could  <eos>
<sos>  bosh  stephen said rudely  a man of genius makes no mistakes  his <eos>
<sos> errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery  <eos>
<sos> portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian  <eos>
<sos> softcreakfooted  bald  eared and assiduous  <eos>
<sos>  a shrew  john eglinton said shrewdly  is not a useful portal of <eos>
<sos> discovery  one should imagine  what useful discovery did socrates learn <eos>
<sos> from xanthippe  <eos>
<sos>  dialectic  stephen answered  and from his mother how to bring thoughts <eos>
<sos> into the world  what he learnt from his other wife myrto  _absit <eos>
<sos> nomen _   socratididion is epipsychidion  no man  not a woman  will ever <eos>
<sos> know  but neither the midwife is lore nor the caudlelectures saved him <eos>
<sos> from the archons of sinn fein and their naggin of hemlock  <eos>
<sos>  but ann hathaway  mr best is quiet voice said forgetfully  yes  we seem <eos>
<sos> to be forgetting her as shakespeare himself forgot her  <eos>
<sos> his look went from brooder is beard to carper is skull  to remind  to <eos>
<sos> chide them not unkindly  then to the baldpink lollard costard  <eos>
<sos> guiltless though maligned  <eos>
<sos>  he had a good groatsworth of wit  stephen said  and no truant memory  <eos>
<sos> he carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to romeville whistling <eos>
<sos> the girl i left behind me  if the earthquake did not time it we <eos>
<sos> should know where to place poor wat  sitting in his form  the cry of <eos>
<sos> hounds  the studded bridle and her blue windows  that memory  _venus <eos>
<sos> and adonis_  lay in the bedchamber of every light of love in london  is <eos>
<sos> katharine the shrew illfavoured  hortensio calls her young and <eos>
<sos> beautiful  do you think the writer of antony and cleopatra  a <eos>
<sos> passionate pilgrim  had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose <eos>
<sos> the ugliest doxy in all warwickshire to lie withal  good  he left her <eos>
<sos> and gained the world of men  but his boywomen are the women of a boy  <eos>
<sos> their life  thought  speech are lent them by males  he chose badly  he <eos>
<sos> was chosen  it seems to me  if others have their will ann hath a way  <eos>
<sos> by cock  she was to blame  she put the comether on him  sweet and <eos>
<sos> twentysix  the greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy adonis  stooping <eos>
<sos> to conquer  as prologue to the swelling act  is a boldfaced stratford <eos>
<sos> wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself  <eos>
<sos> and my turn  when  <eos>
<sos> come  <eos>
<sos>  ryefield  mr best said brightly  gladly  raising his new book  gladly  <eos>
<sos> brightly  <eos>
<sos> he murmured then with blond delight for all  <eos>
<sos> between the acres of the rye <eos>
<sos> these pretty countryfolk would lie  <eos>

<sos> a tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its <eos>
<sos> cooperative watch  <eos>

<sos> for years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt  <eos>
<sos>  they say we are to have a literary surprise  the quaker librarian <eos>
<sos> said  friendly and earnest  mr russell  rumour has it  is gathering <eos>
<sos> together a sheaf of our younger poets  verses  we are all looking <eos>
<sos> forward anxiously  <eos>
<sos> anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces  <eos>
<sos> lighted  shone  <eos>
<sos> see this  remember  <eos>
<sos> stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen  hung on his <eos>
<sos> ashplanthandle over his knee  my casque and sword  touch lightly with <eos>
<sos> two index fingers  aristotle is experiment  one or two  necessity is <eos>
<sos> that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise  <eos>
<sos> argal  one hat is one hat  <eos>
<sos> listen  <eos>
<sos> young colum and starkey  george roberts is doing the commercial part  <eos>
<sos> longworth will give it a good puff in the express  o  will he  i <eos>
<sos> liked colum is drover  yes  i think he has that queer thing genius  do <eos>

<sos> earth a grecian vase_  did he  i hope you ll be able to come tonight  <eos>
<sos> malachi mulligan is coming too  moore asked him to bring haines  did <eos>
<sos> you hear miss mitchell is joke about moore and martyn  that moore is <eos>
<sos> martyn is wild oats  awfully clever  is not it  they remind one of don <eos>
<sos> quixote and sancho panza  our national epic has yet to be written  dr <eos>
<sos> sigerson says  moore is the man for it  a knight of the rueful <eos>
<sos> countenance here in dublin  with a saffron kilt  o neill russell  o  <eos>
<sos> yes  he must speak the grand old tongue  and his dulcinea  james <eos>
<sos> stephens is doing some clever sketches  we are becoming important  it <eos>
<sos> seems  <eos>
<sos> cordelia  cordoglio  lir is loneliest daughter  <eos>
<sos> nookshotten  now your best french polish  <eos>
<sos>  thank you very much  mr russell  stephen said  rising  if you will be <eos>
<sos> so kind as to give the letter to mr norman    <eos>
<sos>  o  yes  if he considers it important it will go in  we have so much <eos>
<sos> correspondence  <eos>
<sos>  i understand  stephen said  thanks  <eos>
<sos> god ild you  the pigs  paper  bullockbefriending  <eos>
<sos> synge has promised me an article for dana too  are we going to be <eos>
<sos> read  i feel we are  the gaelic league wants something in irish  i hope <eos>
<sos> you will come round tonight  bring starkey  <eos>
<sos> stephen sat down  <eos>
<sos> the quaker librarian came from the leavetakers  blushing  his mask <eos>
<sos> said  <eos>
<sos>  mr dedalus  your views are most illuminating  <eos>
<sos> he creaked to and fro  tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a <eos>
<sos> chopine  and  covered by the noise of outgoing  said low  <eos>
<sos>  is it your view  then  that she was not faithful to the poet  <eos>
<sos> alarmed face asks me  why did he come  courtesy or an inward light  <eos>
<sos>  where there is a reconciliation  stephen said  there must have been <eos>
<sos> first a sundering  <eos>
<sos>  yes  <eos>
<sos> christfox in leather trews  hiding  a runaway in blighted treeforks  <eos>
<sos> from hue and cry  knowing no vixen  walking lonely in the chase  women <eos>
<sos> he won to him  tender people  a whore of babylon  ladies of justices  <eos>
<sos> bully tapsters  wives  fox and geese  and in new place a slack <eos>
<sos> dishonoured body that once was comely  once as sweet  as fresh as <eos>
<sos> cinnamon  now her leaves falling  all  bare  frighted of the narrow <eos>
<sos> grave and unforgiven  <eos>
<sos>  yes  so you think    <eos>
<sos> the door closed behind the outgoer  <eos>
<sos> rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell  rest of warm and <eos>
<sos> brooding air  <eos>
<sos> a vestal is lamp  <eos>
<sos> here he ponders things that were not  what cæsar would have lived to do <eos>
<sos> had he believed the soothsayer  what might have been  possibilities of <eos>
<sos> the possible as possible  things not known  what name achilles bore <eos>
<sos> when he lived among women  <eos>
<sos> coffined thoughts around me  in mummycases  embalmed in spice of words  <eos>
<sos> thoth  god of libraries  a birdgod  moonycrowned  and i heard the voice <eos>
<sos> of that egyptian highpriest  _in painted chambers loaded with <eos>
<sos> tilebooks _ <eos>
<sos> they are still  once quick in the brains of men  still  but an itch of <eos>
<sos> death is in them  to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale  urge me to wreak <eos>
<sos> their will  <eos>
<sos>  certainly  john eglinton mused  of all great men he is the most <eos>
<sos> enigmatic  we know nothing but that he lived and suffered  not even so <eos>
<sos> much  others abide our question  a shadow hangs over all the rest  <eos>
<sos>  but hamlet is so personal  is not it  mr best pleaded  i mean  a kind <eos>
<sos> of private paper  do not you know  of his private life  i mean  i do not <eos>
<sos> care a button  do not you know  who is killed or who is guilty    <eos>
<sos> he rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk  smiling his <eos>
<sos> defiance  his private papers in the original  _ta an bad ar an tir  <eos>
<sos> taim in mo shagart_  put beurla on it  littlejohn  <eos>
<sos> quoth littlejohn eglinton  <eos>
<sos>  i was prepared for paradoxes from what malachi mulligan told us but i <eos>
<sos> may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that <eos>
<sos> shakespeare is hamlet you have a stern task before you  <eos>
<sos> bear with me  <eos>
<sos> stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under <eos>
<sos> wrinkled brows  a basilisk  e quando vede l uomo l attosca  messer <eos>
<sos> brunetto  i thank thee for the word  <eos>
<sos>  as we  or mother dana  weave and unweave our bodies  stephen said  <eos>
<sos> from day to day  their molecules shuttled to and fro  so does the <eos>
<sos> artist weave and unweave his image  and as the mole on my right breast <eos>
<sos> is where it was when i was born  though all my body has been woven of <eos>
<sos> new stuff time after time  so through the ghost of the unquiet father <eos>
<sos> the image of the unliving son looks forth  in the intense instant of <eos>
<sos> imagination  when the mind  shelley says  is a fading coal  that which <eos>
<sos> i was is that which i am and that which in possibility i may come to <eos>
<sos> be  so in the future  the sister of the past  i may see myself as i sit <eos>
<sos> here now but by reflection from that which then i shall be  <eos>
<sos> drummond of hawthornden helped you at that stile  <eos>
<sos>  yes  mr best said youngly  i feel hamlet quite young  the bitterness <eos>
<sos> might be from the father but the passages with ophelia are surely from <eos>
<sos> the son  <eos>
<sos> has the wrong sow by the lug  he is in my father  i am in his son  <eos>
<sos>  that mole is the last to go  stephen said  laughing  <eos>
<sos> john eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow  <eos>
<sos>  if that were the birthmark of genius  he said  genius would be a drug <eos>
<sos> in the market  the plays of shakespeare is later years which renan <eos>
<sos> admired so much breathe another spirit  <eos>
<sos>  the spirit of reconciliation  the quaker librarian breathed  <eos>
<sos>  there can be no reconciliation  stephen said  if there has not been a <eos>
<sos> sundering  <eos>
<sos> said that  <eos>
<sos>  if you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over <eos>
<sos> the hell of time of king lear  othello  hamlet  troilus and cressida  <eos>
<sos> look to see when and how the shadow lifts  what softens the heart of a <eos>
<sos> man  shipwrecked in storms dire  tried  like another ulysses  pericles  <eos>
<sos> prince of tyre  <eos>
<sos> head  redconecapped  buffeted  brineblinded  <eos>
<sos>  a child  a girl  placed in his arms  marina  <eos>
<sos>  the leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant <eos>
<sos> quantity  john eglinton detected  the highroads are dreary but they <eos>
<sos> lead to the town  <eos>
<sos> good bacon  gone musty  shakespeare bacon is wild oats  cypherjugglers <eos>
<sos> going the highroads  seekers on the great quest  what town  good <eos>
<sos> masters  mummed in names  a  e   eon  magee  john eglinton  east of the <eos>
<sos> sun  west of the moon  tir na n og  booted the twain and staved  <eos>
<sos> how many miles to dublin  <eos>
<sos> three score and ten  sir  <eos>
<sos> will we be there by candlelight  <eos>
<sos>  mr brandes accepts it  stephen said  as the first play of the closing <eos>
<sos> period  <eos>
<sos>  does he  what does mr sidney lee  or mr simon lazarus as some aver his <eos>
<sos> name is  say of it  <eos>
<sos>  marina  stephen said  a child of storm  miranda  a wonder  perdita  <eos>
<sos> that which was lost  what was lost is given back to him  his daughter is <eos>
<sos> child  my dearest wife  pericles says  was like this maid  will any <eos>
<sos> man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother  <eos>
<sos>  the art of being a grandfather  mr best gan murmur  _l art d être <eos>
<sos> grand_    <eos>
<sos>  will he not see reborn in her  with the memory of his own youth added  <eos>
<sos> another image  <eos>
<sos> do you know what you are talking about  love  yes  word known to all <eos>
<sos> men  _amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus <eos>
<sos>    _ <eos>
<sos>  his own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of <eos>
<sos> all experience  material and moral  such an appeal will touch him  the <eos>
<sos> images of other males of his blood will repel him  he will see in them <eos>
<sos> grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself  <eos>
<sos> the benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope  <eos>
<sos>  i hope mr dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of <eos>
<sos> the public  and we ought to mention another irish commentator  mr <eos>
<sos> george bernard shaw  nor should we forget mr frank harris  his articles <eos>
<sos> on shakespeare in the saturday review were surely brilliant  oddly <eos>
<sos> enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of <eos>
<sos> the sonnets  the favoured rival is william herbert  earl of pembroke  i <eos>
<sos> own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more <eos>
<sos> in harmony with what shall i say  our notions of what ought not to have <eos>
<sos> been  <eos>
<sos> felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them  auk is egg  <eos>
<sos> prize of their fray  <eos>
<sos> he thous and thees her with grave husbandwords  dost love  miriam  dost <eos>
<sos> love thy man  <eos>
<sos>  that may be too  stephen said  there is a saying of goethe is which mr <eos>
<sos> magee likes to quote  beware of what you wish for in youth because you <eos>
<sos> will get it in middle life  why does he send to one who is a <eos>
<sos> buonaroba  a bay where all men ride  a maid of honour with a <eos>
<sos> scandalous girlhood  a lordling to woo for him  he was himself a lord <eos>
<sos> of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had <eos>
<sos> written romeo and juliet  why  belief in himself has been untimely <eos>
<sos> killed  he was overborne in a cornfield first  ryefield  i should say  <eos>
<sos> and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play <eos>
<sos> victoriously the game of laugh and lie down  assumed dongiovannism will <eos>
<sos> not save him  no later undoing will undo the first undoing  the tusk of <eos>
<sos> the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding  if the shrew <eos>
<sos> is worsted yet there remains to her woman is invisible weapon  there is  <eos>
<sos> i feel in the words  some goad of the flesh driving him into a new <eos>
<sos> passion  a darker shadow of the first  darkening even his own <eos>
<sos> understanding of himself  a like fate awaits him and the two rages <eos>
<sos> commingle in a whirlpool  <eos>
<sos> they list  and in the porches of their ears i pour  <eos>
<sos>  the soul has been before stricken mortally  a poison poured in the <eos>
<sos> porch of a sleeping ear  but those who are done to death in sleep <eos>
<sos> cannot know the manner of their quell unless their creator endow their <eos>
<sos> souls with that knowledge in the life to come  the poisoning and the <eos>
<sos> beast with two backs that urged it king hamlet is ghost could not know <eos>
<sos> of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator  that is why the <eos>
<sos> speech  his lean unlovely english  is always turned elsewhere  <eos>
<sos> backward  ravisher and ravished  what he would but would not  go with <eos>
<sos> him from lucrece is bluecircled ivory globes to imogen is breast  bare  <eos>
<sos> with its mole cinquespotted  he goes back  weary of the creation he has <eos>
<sos> piled up to hide him from himself  an old dog licking an old sore  but  <eos>
<sos> because loss is his gain  he passes on towards eternity in undiminished <eos>
<sos> personality  untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he <eos>
<sos> has revealed  his beaver is up  he is a ghost  a shadow now  the wind <eos>
<sos> by elsinore is rocks or what you will  the sea is voice  a voice heard <eos>
<sos> only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow  the son <eos>
<sos> consubstantial with the father  <eos>
<sos>  amen  was responded from the doorway  <eos>
<sos> hast thou found me  o mine enemy  <eos>
<sos> entr acte  <eos>
<sos> a ribald face  sullen as a dean is  buck mulligan came forward  then <eos>
<sos> blithe in motley  towards the greeting of their smiles  my telegram  <eos>
<sos>  you were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate  if i mistake not  he <eos>
<sos> asked of stephen  <eos>
<sos> primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed panama as with a <eos>
<sos> bauble  <eos>
<sos> they make him welcome  was du verlachst wirst du noch dienen  <eos>
<sos> brood of mockers  photius  pseudomalachi  johann most  <eos>
<sos> he who himself begot middler the holy ghost and himself sent himself  <eos>
<sos> agenbuyer  between himself and others  who  put upon by his fiends  <eos>
<sos> stripped and whipped  was nailed like bat to barndoor  starved on <eos>
<sos> crosstree  who let him bury  stood up  harrowed hell  fared into heaven <eos>
<sos> and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of his <eos>
<sos> own self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and <eos>
<sos> dead when all the quick shall be dead already  <eos>
<sos>  illustration  <eos>
<sos> he lifts his hands  veils fall  o  flowers  bells with bells with bells <eos>
<sos> aquiring  <eos>
<sos>  yes  indeed  the quaker librarian said  a most instructive discussion  <eos>
<sos> mr mulligan  i ll be bound  has his theory too of the play and of <eos>
<sos> shakespeare  all sides of life should be represented  <eos>
<sos> he smiled on all sides equally  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan thought  puzzled  <eos>
<sos>  shakespeare  he said  i seem to know the name  <eos>
<sos> a flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features  <eos>
<sos>  to be sure  he said  remembering brightly  the chap that writes like <eos>
<sos> synge  <eos>
<sos> mr best turned to him  <eos>
<sos>  haines missed you  he said  did you meet him  he ll see you after at <eos>
<sos> the d  b  c  he is gone to gill is to buy hyde is lovesongs of connacht  <eos>
<sos>  i came through the museum  buck mulligan said  was he here  <eos>
<sos>  the bard is fellowcountrymen  john eglinton answered  are rather tired <eos>
<sos> perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising  i hear that an actress <eos>
<sos> played hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in dublin  <eos>
<sos> vining held that the prince was a woman  has no one made him out to be <eos>
<sos> an irishman  judge barton  i believe  is searching for some clues  he <eos>
<sos> swears  his highness not his lordship  by saint patrick  <eos>
<sos>  the most brilliant of all is that story of wilde is  mr best said  <eos>
<sos> lifting his brilliant notebook  that portrait of mr w  h  where he <eos>
<sos> proves that the sonnets were written by a willie hughes  a man all <eos>
<sos> hues  <eos>
<sos>  for willie hughes  is it not  the quaker librarian asked  <eos>
<sos> or hughie wills  mr william himself  w  h   who am i  <eos>
<sos>  i mean  for willie hughes  mr best said  amending his gloss easily  of <eos>
<sos> course it is all paradox  do not you know  hughes and hews and hues  the <eos>
<sos> colour  but it is so typical the way he works it out  it is the very <eos>
<sos> essence of wilde  do not you know  the light touch  <eos>
<sos> his glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled  a blond ephebe  <eos>
<sos> tame essence of wilde  <eos>
<sos> you re darned witty  three drams of usquebaugh you drank with dan <eos>
<sos> deasy is ducats  <eos>
<sos> how much did i spend  o  a few shillings  <eos>
<sos> for a plump of pressmen  humour wet and dry  <eos>
<sos> wit  you would give your five wits for youth is proud livery he pranks <eos>
<sos> in  lineaments of gratified desire  <eos>
<sos> there be many mo  take her for me  in pairing time  jove  a cool <eos>
<sos> ruttime send them  yea  turtledove her  <eos>
<sos> eve  naked wheatbellied sin  a snake coils her  fang in is kiss  <eos>
<sos>  do you think it is only a paradox  the quaker librarian was asking  <eos>
<sos> the mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious  <eos>
<sos> they talked seriously of mocker is seriousness  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan is again heavy face eyed stephen awhile  then  his head <eos>
<sos> wagging  he came near  drew a folded telegram from his pocket  his <eos>
<sos> mobile lips read  smiling with new delight  <eos>
<sos>  telegram  he said  wonderful inspiration  telegram  a papal bull  <eos>
<sos> he sat on a corner of the unlit desk  reading aloud joyfully  <eos>
<sos>  _the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the <eos>
<sos> immense debtorship for a thing done _ signed  dedalus  where did you <eos>
<sos> launch it from  the kips  no  college green  have you drunk the four <eos>

<sos> joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a <eos>
<sos> querulous brogue  <eos>
<sos>  it is what i am telling you  mister honey  it is queer and sick we were  <eos>
<sos> haines and myself  the time himself brought it in   twas murmur we did <eos>
<sos> for a gallus potion would rouse a friar  i am thinking  and he limp with <eos>

<sos>  and we to be there  mavrone  and you to be unbeknownst sending us your <eos>
<sos> conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the <eos>
<sos> drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful  <eos>
<sos> stephen laughed  <eos>
<sos> quickly  warningfully buck mulligan bent down  <eos>
<sos>  the tramper synge is looking for you  he said  to murder you  he heard <eos>
<sos> you pissed on his halldoor in glasthule  he is out in pampooties to <eos>
<sos> murder you  <eos>

<sos> buck mulligan gleefully bent back  laughing to the dark eavesdropping <eos>
<sos> ceiling  <eos>
<sos>  murder you  he laughed  <eos>
<sos> harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of <eos>
<sos> lights in rue saint andré des arts  in words of words for words  <eos>

<sos> dark figure following his hasty heels  <eos>
<sos> the door closed  <eos>
<sos>  the sheeny  buck mulligan cried  <eos>
<sos> he jumped up and snatched the card  <eos>

<sos>  antisthenes  pupil of gorgias  stephen said  took the palm of beauty <eos>
<sos> from kyrios menelaus  brooddam  argive helen  the wooden mare of troy <eos>
<sos> in whom a score of heroes slept  and handed it to poor penelope  twenty <eos>
<sos> years he lived in london and  during part of that time  he drew a <eos>
<sos> salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of ireland  his life was <eos>
<sos> rich  his art  more than the art of feudalism as walt whitman called <eos>
<sos> it  is the art of surfeit  hot herringpies  green mugs of sack  <eos>

<sos> buck mulligan  his pious eyes upturned  prayed  <eos>
<sos>  blessed margaret mary anycock  <eos>
<sos>  and harry of six wives  daughter  and other lady friends from <eos>
<sos> neighbour seats as lawn tennyson  gentleman poet  sings  but all those <eos>
<sos> twenty years what do you suppose poor penelope in stratford was doing <eos>
<sos> behind the diamond panes  <eos>
<sos> do and do  thing done  in a rosery of fetter lane of gerard  herbalist  <eos>
<sos> he walks  greyedauburn  an azured harebell like her veins  lids of <eos>
<sos> juno is eyes  violets  he walks  one life is all  one body  do  but do  <eos>
<sos> afar  in a reek of lust and squalor  hands are laid on whiteness  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan rapped john eglinton is desk sharply  <eos>
<sos>  whom do you suspect  he challenged  <eos>
<sos>  say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets  once spurned twice <eos>
<sos> spurned  but the court wanton spurned him for a lord  his dearmylove  <eos>
<sos> love that dare not speak its name  <eos>
<sos>  as an englishman  you mean  john sturdy eglinton put in  he loved a <eos>
<sos> lord  <eos>
<sos> old wall where sudden lizards flash  at charenton i watched them  <eos>
<sos>  it seems so  stephen said  when he wants to do for him  and for all <eos>
<sos> other and singular uneared wombs  the holy office an ostler does for <eos>
<sos> the stallion  maybe  like socrates  he had a midwife to mother as he <eos>
<sos> had a shrew to wife  but she  the giglot wanton  did not break a <eos>
<sos> bedvow  two deeds are rank in that ghost is mind  a broken vow and the <eos>
<sos> dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined  deceased husband is <eos>
<sos> brother  sweet ann  i take it  was hot in the blood  once a wooer  <eos>
<sos> twice a wooer  <eos>
<sos> stephen turned boldly in his chair  <eos>
<sos>  the burden of proof is with you not with me  he said frowning  if you <eos>
<sos> deny that in the fifth scene of hamlet he has branded her with infamy <eos>
<sos> tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years <eos>
<sos> between the day she married him and the day she buried him  all those <eos>
<sos> women saw their men down and under  mary  her goodman john  ann  her <eos>
<sos> poor dear willun  when he went and died on her  raging that he was the <eos>
<sos> first to go  joan  her four brothers  judith  her husband and all her <eos>
<sos> sons  susan  her husband too  while susan is daughter  elizabeth  to use <eos>
<sos> granddaddy is words  wed her second  having killed her first  <eos>
<sos> o  yes  mention there is  in the years when he was living richly in <eos>
<sos> royal london to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her <eos>
<sos> father is shepherd  explain you then  explain the swansong too wherein <eos>
<sos> he has commended her to posterity  <eos>
<sos> he faced their silence  <eos>
<sos> to whom thus eglinton  you mean the will  <eos>
<sos> but that has been explained  i believe  by jurists  <eos>
<sos> she was entitled to her widow is dower <eos>
<sos> at common law  his legal knowledge was great <eos>
<sos> our judges tell us  <eos>
<sos> him satan fleers  <eos>
<sos> mocker  <eos>
<sos> and therefore he left out her name <eos>
<sos> from the first draft but he did not leave out <eos>
<sos> the presents for his granddaughter  for his daughters  <eos>
<sos> for his sister  for his old cronies in stratford <eos>
<sos> and in london  and therefore when he was urged  <eos>
<sos> as i believe  to name her <eos>
<sos> he left her his <eos>
<sos> secondbest <eos>
<sos> bed  <eos>

<sos> woa  <eos>
<sos>  pretty countryfolk had few chattels then  john eglinton observed  as <eos>
<sos> they have still if our peasant plays are true to type  <eos>
<sos>  he was a rich country gentleman  stephen said  with a coat of arms and <eos>
<sos> landed estate at stratford and a house in ireland yard  a capitalist <eos>
<sos> shareholder  a bill promoter  a tithefarmer  why did he not leave her <eos>
<sos> his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in <eos>
<sos> peace  <eos>
<sos>  it is clear that there were two beds  a best and a secondbest  mr <eos>
<sos> secondbest best said finely  <eos>
<sos>  separatio a mensa et a thalamo  bettered buck mulligan and was <eos>
<sos> smiled on  <eos>
<sos>  antiquity mentions famous beds  second eglinton puckered  bedsmiling  <eos>
<sos> let me think  <eos>
<sos>  antiquity mentions that stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage  <eos>
<sos> stephen said  who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves  pays <eos>
<sos> tribute to his elders  wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his <eos>
<sos> dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress  do not forget <eos>
<sos> nell gwynn herpyllis  and let her live in his villa  <eos>
<sos>  do you mean he died so  mr best asked with slight concern  i mean    <eos>
<sos>  he died dead drunk  buck mulligan capped  a quart of ale is a dish for <eos>
<sos> a king  o  i must tell you what dowden said  <eos>
<sos>  what  asked besteglinton  <eos>
<sos> william shakespeare and company  limited  the people is william  for <eos>
<sos> terms apply  e  dowden  highfield house    <eos>
<sos>  lovely  buck mulligan suspired amorously  i asked him what he thought <eos>
<sos> of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard  he lifted his <eos>
<sos> hands and said  _all we can say is that life ran very high in those <eos>
<sos> days _ lovely  <eos>
<sos> catamite  <eos>
<sos>  the sense of beauty leads us astray  said beautifulinsadness best to <eos>
<sos> ugling eglinton  <eos>
<sos> steadfast john replied severe  <eos>
<sos>  the doctor can tell us what those words mean  you cannot eat your cake <eos>
<sos> and have it  <eos>
<sos> sayest thou so  will they wrest from us  from me  the palm of beauty  <eos>
<sos>  and the sense of property  stephen said  he drew shylock out of his <eos>
<sos> own long pocket  the son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself <eos>
<sos> a cornjobber and moneylender  with ten tods of corn hoarded in the <eos>
<sos> famine riots  his borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship <eos>
<sos> mentioned by chettle falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing  <eos>
<sos> he sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted <eos>
<sos> his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent  how else could <eos>
<sos> aubrey is ostler and callboy get rich quick  all events brought grist to <eos>

<sos>  he was made in germany  stephen replied  as the champion french <eos>
<sos> polisher of italian scandals  <eos>

<sos> what more is to speak  <eos>
<sos> stephen looked on his hat  his stick  his boots  <eos>
<sos> stephanos  my crown  my sword  his boots are spoiling the shape of my <eos>

<sos>  you make good use of the name  john eglinton allowed  your own name is <eos>

<sos> mr best eagerquietly lifted his book to say  <eos>
<sos>  that is very interesting because that brother motive  do not you know  <eos>
<sos> we find also in the old irish myths  just what you say  the three <eos>
<sos> brothers shakespeare  in grimm too  do not you know  the fairytales  the <eos>
<sos> third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best <eos>
<sos> prize  <eos>
<sos> best of best brothers  good  better  best  <eos>
<sos> the quaker librarian springhalted near  <eos>
<sos>  i should like to know  he said  which brother you    i understand you <eos>
<sos> to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers    but perhaps <eos>
<sos> i am anticipating  <eos>
<sos> he caught himself in the act  looked at all  refrained  <eos>
<sos> an attendant from the doorway called  <eos>
<sos>  mr lyster  father dineen wants    <eos>
<sos>  o  father dineen  directly  <eos>
<sos> swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone  <eos>
<sos> john eglinton touched the foil  <eos>
<sos>  come  he said  let us hear what you have to say of richard and edmund  <eos>
<sos> you kept them for the last  did not you  <eos>
<sos>  in asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle richie and <eos>
<sos> nuncle edmund  stephen answered  i feel i am asking too much perhaps  a <eos>
<sos> brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella  <eos>
<sos> lapwing  <eos>
<sos> where is your brother  apothecaries  hall  my whetstone  him  then <eos>

<sos>  you will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he <eos>
<sos> took the stuff of his plays  why did he take them rather than others  <eos>
<sos> richard  a whoreson crookback  misbegotten  makes love to a widowed ann <eos>
<sos>  what is in a name    woos and wins her  a whoreson merry widow  richard <eos>
<sos> the conqueror  third brother  came after william the conquered  the <eos>
<sos> other four acts of that play hang limply from that first  of all his <eos>
<sos> kings richard is the only king unshielded by shakespeare is reverence  <eos>
<sos> the angel of the world  why is the underplot of king lear in which <eos>
<sos> edmund figures lifted out of sidney is arcadia and spatchcocked on to <eos>
<sos> a celtic legend older than history  <eos>
<sos>  that was will is way  john eglinton defended  we should not now combine <eos>
<sos> a norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by george meredith  _que <eos>
<sos> voulez vous _ moore would say  he puts bohemia on the seacoast and <eos>
<sos> makes ulysses quote aristotle  <eos>
<sos>  why  stephen answered himself  because the theme of the false or the <eos>
<sos> usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to <eos>
<sos> shakespeare  what the poor are not  always with him  the note of <eos>
<sos> banishment  banishment from the heart  banishment from home  sounds <eos>
<sos> uninterruptedly from the two gentlemen of verona onward till prospero <eos>
<sos> breaks his staff  buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his <eos>
<sos> book  it doubles itself in the middle of his life  reflects itself in <eos>
<sos> another  repeats itself  protasis  epitasis  catastasis  catastrophe  <eos>
<sos> it repeats itself again when he is near the grave  when his married <eos>
<sos> daughter susan  chip of the old block  is accused of adultery  but it <eos>
<sos> was the original sin that darkened his understanding  weakened his will <eos>
<sos> and left in him a strong inclination to evil  the words are those of my <eos>
<sos> lords bishops of maynooth  an original sin and  like original sin  <eos>
<sos> committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned  it is between the <eos>
<sos> lines of his last written words  it is petrified on his tombstone under <eos>
<sos> which her four bones are not to be laid  age has not withered it  <eos>
<sos> beauty and peace have not done it away  it is in infinite variety <eos>
<sos> everywhere in the world he has created  in much ado about nothing  <eos>
<sos> twice in as you like it  in the tempest  in hamlet  in _measure <eos>
<sos> for measure_ and in all the other plays which i have not read  <eos>
<sos> he laughed to free his mind from his mind is bondage  <eos>
<sos> judge eglinton summed up  <eos>
<sos>  the truth is midway  he affirmed  he is the ghost and the prince  he <eos>
<sos> is all in all  <eos>
<sos>  he is  stephen said  the boy of act one is the mature man of act five  <eos>
<sos> all in all  in cymbeline  in othello he is bawd and cuckold  he <eos>
<sos> acts and is acted on  lover of an ideal or a perversion  like josé he <eos>
<sos> kills the real carmen  his unremitting intellect is the hornmad iago <eos>
<sos> ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer  <eos>
<sos>  cuckoo  cuckoo  cuck mulligan clucked lewdly  o word of fear  <eos>
<sos> dark dome received  reverbed  <eos>
<sos>  and what a character is iago  undaunted john eglinton exclaimed  when <eos>
<sos> all is said dumas fils  or is it dumas père   is right  after god <eos>
<sos> shakespeare has created most  <eos>
<sos>  man delights him not nor woman neither  stephen said  he returns after <eos>
<sos> a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born  where he has <eos>
<sos> always been  man and boy  a silent witness and there  his journey of <eos>
<sos> life ended  he plants his mulberrytree in the earth  then dies  the <eos>
<sos> motion is ended  gravediggers bury hamlet père and hamlet fils  a <eos>
<sos> king and a prince at last in death  with incidental music  and  what <eos>
<sos> though murdered and betrayed  bewept by all frail tender hearts for  <eos>
<sos> dane or dubliner  sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom <eos>
<sos> they refuse to be divorced  if you like the epilogue look long on it  <eos>
<sos> prosperous prospero  the good man rewarded  lizzie  grandpa is lump of <eos>
<sos> love  and nuncle richie  the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the <eos>
<sos> place where the bad niggers go  strong curtain  he found in the world <eos>
<sos> without as actual what was in his world within as possible  maeterlinck <eos>
<sos> says  _if socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated <eos>
<sos> on his doorstep  if judas go forth tonight it is to judas his steps <eos>
<sos> will tend _ every life is many days  day after day  we walk through <eos>
<sos> ourselves  meeting robbers  ghosts  giants  old men  young men  wives  <eos>
<sos> widows  brothers in love  but always meeting ourselves  the playwright <eos>
<sos> who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly  he gave us light <eos>
<sos> first and the sun two days later   the lord of things as they are whom <eos>
<sos> the most roman of catholics call dio boia  hangman god  is doubtless <eos>
<sos> all in all in all of us  ostler and butcher  and would be bawd and <eos>
<sos> cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven  foretold by hamlet  <eos>
<sos> there are no more marriages  glorified man  an androgynous angel  being <eos>

<sos> your own theory  <eos>
<sos>  no  stephen said promptly  <eos>
<sos>  are you going to write it  mr best asked  you ought to make it a <eos>
<sos> dialogue  do not you know  like the platonic dialogues wilde wrote  <eos>
<sos> john eclecticon doubly smiled  <eos>
<sos>  well  in that case  he said  i do not see why you should expect payment <eos>
<sos> for it since you do not believe it yourself  dowden believes there is <eos>
<sos> some mystery in hamlet but will say no more  herr bleibtreu  the man <eos>
<sos> piper met in berlin  who is working up that rutland theory  believes <eos>
<sos> that the secret is hidden in the stratford monument  he is going to <eos>
<sos> visit the present duke  piper says  and prove to him that his ancestor <eos>
<sos> wrote the plays  it will come as a surprise to his grace  but he <eos>

<sos> a onelegged sailor  swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his <eos>
<sos> crutches  growled some notes  he jerked short before the convent of the <eos>
<sos> sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very <eos>
<sos> reverend john conmee s  j  father conmee blessed him in the sun for his <eos>
<sos> purse held  he knew  one silver crown  <eos>
<sos> father conmee crossed to mountjoy square  he thought  but not for long  <eos>
<sos> of soldiers and sailors  whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs  <eos>
<sos> ending their days in some pauper ward  and of cardinal wolsey is words  <eos>
<sos> _if i had served my god as i have served my king he would not have <eos>
<sos> abandoned me in my old days _ he walked by the treeshade of <eos>
<sos> sunnywinking leaves  and towards him came the wife of mr david sheehy <eos>
<sos> m p  <eos>
<sos>  very well  indeed  father  and you  father  <eos>
<sos> father conmee was wonderfully well indeed  he would go to buxton <eos>
<sos> probably for the waters  and her boys  were they getting on well at <eos>

<sos> that  and mr sheehy himself  still in london  the house was still <eos>

<sos> iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to mr david sheehy m p  <eos>
<sos> yes  he would certainly call  <eos>
<sos>  good afternoon  mrs sheehy  <eos>
<sos> father conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled  as he took leave  at the <eos>
<sos> jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun  and smiled yet again  <eos>
<sos> in going  he had cleaned his teeth  he knew  with arecanut paste  <eos>
<sos> father conmee walked and  walking  smiled for he thought on father <eos>
<sos> bernard vaughan is droll eyes and cockney voice  <eos>
<sos>  pilate  wy do not you old back that owlin mob  <eos>
<sos> a zealous man  however  really he was  and really did great good in his <eos>
<sos> way  beyond a doubt  he loved ireland  he said  and he loved the irish  <eos>
<sos> of good family too would one think it  welsh  were they not  <eos>
<sos> o  lest he forget  that letter to father provincial  <eos>
<sos> father conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of mountjoy <eos>
<sos> square  yes  they were from belvedere  the little house  aha  and were <eos>
<sos> they good boys at school  o  that was very good now  and what was his <eos>
<sos> name  jack sohan  and his name  ger  gallaher  and the other little <eos>
<sos> man  his name was brunny lynam  o  that was a very nice name to have  <eos>
<sos> father conmee gave a letter from his breast to master brunny lynam and <eos>
<sos> pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of fitzgibbon street  <eos>
<sos>  but mind you do not post yourself into the box  little man  he said  <eos>
<sos> the boys sixeyed father conmee and laughed  <eos>
<sos>  o  sir  <eos>
<sos>  well  let me see if you can post a letter  father conmee said  <eos>
<sos> master brunny lynam ran across the road and put father conmee is letter <eos>
<sos> to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox  father <eos>
<sos> conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along mountjoy square <eos>
<sos> east  <eos>
<sos> mr denis j maginni  professor of dancing  c  in silk hat  slate <eos>
<sos> frockcoat with silk facings  white kerchief tie  tight lavender <eos>
<sos> trousers  canary gloves and pointed patent boots  walking with grave <eos>
<sos> deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady <eos>
<sos> maxwell at the corner of dignam is court  <eos>
<sos> was that not mrs m guinness  <eos>
<sos> mrs m guinness  stately  silverhaired  bowed to father conmee from the <eos>
<sos> farther footpath along which she sailed  and father conmee smiled and <eos>
<sos> saluted  how did she do  <eos>
<sos> a fine carriage she had  like mary  queen of scots  something  and to <eos>
<sos> think that she was a pawnbroker  well  now  such a    what should he <eos>
<sos> say     such a queenly mien  <eos>
<sos> father conmee walked down great charles street and glanced at the <eos>
<sos> shutup free church on his left  the reverend t  r  greene b a  will <eos>
<sos>  d v   speak  the incumbent they called him  he felt it incumbent on <eos>
<sos> him to say a few words  but one should be charitable  invincible <eos>
<sos> ignorance  they acted according to their lights  <eos>
<sos> father conmee turned the corner and walked along the north circular <eos>
<sos> road  it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an <eos>
<sos> important thoroughfare  surely  there ought to be  <eos>
<sos> a band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from richmond street  all <eos>
<sos> raised untidy caps  father conmee greeted them more than once benignly  <eos>
<sos> christian brother boys  <eos>
<sos> father conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked  saint <eos>
<sos> joseph is church  portland row  for aged and virtuous females  father <eos>
<sos> conmee raised his hat to the blessed sacrament  virtuous  but <eos>
<sos> occasionally they were also badtempered  <eos>
<sos> near aldborough house father conmee thought of that spendthrift <eos>
<sos> nobleman  and now it was an office or something  <eos>
<sos> father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted <eos>
<sos> by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop  father <eos>
<sos> conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came <eos>
<sos> from baconflitches and ample cools of butter  he passed grogan is the <eos>
<sos> tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful <eos>
<sos> catastrophe in new york  in america those things were continually <eos>
<sos> happening  unfortunate people to die like that  unprepared  still  an <eos>
<sos> act of perfect contrition  <eos>
<sos> father conmee went by daniel bergin is publichouse against the window of <eos>
<sos> which two unlabouring men lounged  they saluted him and were saluted  <eos>
<sos> father conmee passed h  j  o neill is funeral establishment where corny <eos>
<sos> kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay  <eos>
<sos> a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted <eos>
<sos> the constable  in youkstetter is  the porkbutcher is  father conmee <eos>
<sos> observed pig is puddings  white and black and red  lie neatly curled in <eos>
<sos> tubes  <eos>
<sos> moored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a <eos>
<sos> turfbarge  a towhorse with pendent head  a bargeman with a hat of dirty <eos>
<sos> straw seated amidships  smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above <eos>
<sos> him  it was idyllic  and father conmee reflected on the providence of <eos>
<sos> the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out <eos>
<sos> and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor <eos>
<sos> people  <eos>
<sos> on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s  j  of saint francis <eos>
<sos> xavier is church  upper gardiner street  stepped on to an outward bound <eos>
<sos> tram  <eos>
<sos> off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley c  c  of <eos>
<sos> saint agatha is church  north william street  on to newcomen bridge  <eos>
<sos> at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for <eos>
<sos> he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island  <eos>
<sos> father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar  a blue ticket tucked with <eos>
<sos> care in the eye of one plump kid glove  while four shillings  a <eos>
<sos> sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into <eos>
<sos> his purse  passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket <eos>
<sos> inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away <eos>
<sos> the ticket  the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father <eos>
<sos> conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap  father conmee liked <eos>
<sos> cheerful decorum  <eos>
<sos> it was a peaceful day  the gentleman with the glasses opposite father <eos>
<sos> conmee had finished explaining and looked down  his wife  father conmee <eos>
<sos> supposed  a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman <eos>
<sos> with the glasses  she raised her small gloved fist  yawned ever so <eos>
<sos> gently  tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and <eos>
<sos> smiled tinily  sweetly  <eos>
<sos> father conmee perceived her perfume in the car  he perceived also that <eos>
<sos> the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the <eos>
<sos> seat  <eos>
<sos> father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the <eos>
<sos> mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head  <eos>
<sos> at annesley bridge the tram halted and  when it was about to go  an old <eos>
<sos> woman rose suddenly from her place to alight  the conductor pulled the <eos>
<sos> bellstrap to stay the car for her  she passed out with her basket and a <eos>
<sos> marketnet  and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and <eos>
<sos> basket down  and father conmee thought that  as she had nearly passed <eos>
<sos> the end of the penny fare  she was one of those good souls who had <eos>
<sos> always to be told twice bless you  my child  that they have been <eos>
<sos> absolved  pray for me  but they had so many worries in life  so many <eos>
<sos> cares  poor creatures  <eos>
<sos> from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at <eos>
<sos> father conmee  <eos>
<sos> father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men <eos>
<sos> and of his sermon on saint peter claver s  j  and the african mission <eos>
<sos> and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and <eos>
<sos> brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when <eos>
<sos> their last hour came like a thief in the night  that book by the <eos>
<sos> belgian jesuit  le nombre des élus  seemed to father conmee a <eos>
<sos> reasonable plea  those were millions of human souls created by god in <eos>
<sos> his own likeness to whom the faith had not  d v   been brought  but <eos>
<sos> they were god is souls  created by god  it seemed to father conmee a <eos>
<sos> pity that they should all be lost  a waste  if one might say  <eos>
<sos> at the howth road stop father conmee alighted  was saluted by the <eos>
<sos> conductor and saluted in his turn  <eos>
<sos> the malahide road was quiet  it pleased father conmee  road and name  <eos>
<sos> the joybells were ringing in gay malahide  lord talbot de malahide  <eos>
<sos> immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining  <eos>
<sos> then came the call to arms and she was maid  wife and widow in one day  <eos>
<sos> those were old worldish days  loyal times in joyous townlands  old <eos>
<sos> times in the barony  <eos>
<sos> father conmee  walking  thought of his little book _old times in the <eos>
<sos> barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and <eos>
<sos> of mary rochfort  daughter of lord molesworth  first countess of <eos>
<sos> belvedere  <eos>
<sos> a listless lady  no more young  walked alone the shore of lough ennel  <eos>
<sos> mary  first countess of belvedere  listlessly walking in the evening  <eos>
<sos> not startled when an otter plunged  who could know the truth  not the <eos>
<sos> jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed <eos>
<sos> adultery fully  eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris  with <eos>
<sos> her husband is brother  she would half confess if she had not all sinned <eos>
<sos> as women did  only god knew and she and he  her husband is brother  <eos>
<sos> father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence  needed however <eos>
<sos> for man is race on earth  and of the ways of god which were not our <eos>
<sos> ways  <eos>
<sos> don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore  he was humane and <eos>
<sos> honoured there  he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at <eos>
<sos> smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom  ceiled with full fruit <eos>
<sos> clusters  and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom  noble to noble  <eos>
<sos> were impalmed by don john conmee  <eos>
<sos> it was a charming day  <eos>
<sos> the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages  <eos>
<sos> curtseying to him with ample underleaves  the sky showed him a flock of <eos>
<sos> small white clouds going slowly down the wind  moutonner  the french <eos>
<sos> said  a just and homely word  <eos>
<sos> father conmee  reading his office  watched a flock of muttoning clouds <eos>
<sos> over rathcoffey  his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of <eos>
<sos> clongowes field  he walked there  reading in the evening  and heard the <eos>
<sos> cries of the boys  lines at their play  young cries in the quiet <eos>
<sos> evening  he was their rector  his reign was mild  <eos>
<sos> father conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out  <eos>
<sos> an ivory bookmark told him the page  <eos>
<sos> nones  he should have read that before lunch  but lady maxwell had <eos>
<sos> come  <eos>
<sos> father conmee read in secret pater and ave and crossed his breast  <eos>
<sos> deus in adiutorium  <eos>
<sos> he walked calmly and read mutely the nones  walking and reading till he <eos>
<sos> came to res in _beati immaculati  principium verborum tuorum veritas  <eos>
<sos> in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ _ <eos>
<sos> a flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a <eos>
<sos> young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand  the young man raised <eos>
<sos> his cap abruptly  the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care <eos>
<sos> detached from her light skirt a clinging twig  <eos>
<sos> father conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his <eos>
<sos> breviary  _sin  principes persecuti sunt me gratis  et a verbis tuis <eos>
<sos> formidavit cor meum _ <eos>
<sos> corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping <eos>
<sos> eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner  he pulled himself erect  <eos>
<sos> went to it and  spinning it on its axle  viewed its shape and brass <eos>
<sos> furnishings  chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came <eos>
<sos> to the doorway  there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes <eos>
<sos> and leaned against the doorcase  looking idly out  <eos>
<sos> father john conmee stepped into the dollymount tram on newcomen bridge  <eos>
<sos> corny kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed  his hat <eos>
<sos> downtilted  chewing his blade of hay  <eos>
<sos> constable 57c  on his beat  stood to pass the time of day  <eos>
<sos>  that is a fine day  mr kelleher  <eos>
<sos>  ay  corny kelleher said  <eos>
<sos>  it is very close  the constable said  <eos>
<sos> corny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth <eos>
<sos> while a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a <eos>
<sos> coin  <eos>
<sos>  what is the best news  he asked  <eos>
<sos>  i seen that particular party last evening  the constable said with <eos>
<sos> bated breath  <eos>
<sos> a onelegged sailor crutched himself round macconnell is corner  skirting <eos>
<sos> rabaiotti is icecream car  and jerked himself up eccles street  towards <eos>
<sos> larry o rourke  in shirtsleeves in his doorway  he growled unamiably  <eos>
<sos>  for england    <eos>
<sos> he swung himself violently forward past katey and boody dedalus  halted <eos>
<sos> and growled  <eos>
<sos>  home and beauty  <eos>
<sos> j  j  o molloy is white careworn face was told that mr lambert was in <eos>
<sos> the warehouse with a visitor  <eos>
<sos> a stout lady stopped  took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it <eos>
<sos> into the cap held out to her  the sailor grumbled thanks  glanced <eos>
<sos> sourly at the unheeding windows  sank his head and swung himself <eos>
<sos> forward four strides  <eos>
<sos> he halted and growled angrily  <eos>
<sos>  for england    <eos>
<sos> two barefoot urchins  sucking long liquorice laces  halted near him  <eos>
<sos> gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths  <eos>
<sos> he swung himself forward in vigorous jerks  halted  lifted his head <eos>
<sos> towards a window and bayed deeply  <eos>
<sos>  home and beauty  <eos>
<sos> the gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two  ceased  <eos>
<sos> the blind of the window was drawn aside  a card _unfurnished <eos>
<sos> apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell  a plump bare generous arm <eos>
<sos> shone  was seen  held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut <eos>
<sos> shiftstraps  a woman is hand flung forth a coin over the area railings  <eos>
<sos> it fell on the path  <eos>
<sos> one of the urchins ran to it  picked it up and dropped it into the <eos>
<sos> minstrel is cap  saying  <eos>
<sos>  there  sir  <eos>
<sos> katey and boody dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming <eos>
<sos> kitchen  <eos>
<sos>  did you put in the books  boody asked  <eos>
<sos> maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds <eos>
<sos> twice with her potstick and wiped her brow  <eos>
<sos>  they would not give anything on them  she said  <eos>
<sos> father conmee walked through clongowes fields  his thinsocked ankles <eos>
<sos> tickled by stubble  <eos>
<sos>  where did you try  boody asked  <eos>
<sos>  m guinness is  <eos>
<sos> boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table  <eos>
<sos>  bad cess to her big face  she cried  <eos>
<sos> katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes  <eos>
<sos>  what is in the pot  she asked  <eos>
<sos>  shirts  maggy said  <eos>
<sos> boody cried angrily  <eos>
<sos>  crickey  is there nothing for us to eat  <eos>
<sos> katey  lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt  asked  <eos>
<sos>  and what is in this  <eos>
<sos> a heavy fume gushed in answer  <eos>
<sos>  peasoup  maggy said  <eos>
<sos>  where did you get it  katey asked  <eos>
<sos>  sister mary patrick  maggy said  <eos>
<sos> the lacquey rang his bell  <eos>
<sos>  barang  <eos>
<sos> boody sat down at the table and said hungrily  <eos>
<sos>  give us it here  <eos>
<sos> maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl  katey  <eos>
<sos> sitting opposite boody  said quietly  as her fingertip lifted to her <eos>
<sos> mouth random crumbs  <eos>
<sos>  a good job we have that much  where is dilly  <eos>
<sos>  gone to meet father  maggy said  <eos>
<sos> boody  breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup  added  <eos>
<sos>  our father who art not in heaven  <eos>
<sos> maggy  pouring yellow soup in katey is bowl  exclaimed  <eos>
<sos>  boody  for shame  <eos>
<sos> a skiff  a crumpled throwaway  elijah is coming  rode lightly down the <eos>
<sos> liffey  under loopline bridge  shooting the rapids where water chafed <eos>
<sos> around the bridgepiers  sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains  <eos>
<sos> between the customhouse old dock and george is quay  <eos>
<sos> the blond girl in thornton is bedded the wicker basket with rustling <eos>
<sos> fibre  blazes boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper <eos>
<sos> and a small jar  <eos>
<sos>  put these in first  will you  he said  <eos>
<sos>  yes  sir  the blond girl said  and the fruit on top  <eos>
<sos>  that ll do  game ball  blazes boylan said  <eos>
<sos> she bestowed fat pears neatly  head by tail  and among them ripe <eos>
<sos> shamefaced peaches  <eos>
<sos> blazes boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the <eos>
<sos> fruitsmelling shop  lifting fruits  young juicy crinkled and plump red <eos>
<sos> tomatoes  sniffing smells  <eos>
<sos> h  e  l  y  s filed before him  tallwhitehatted  past tangier lane  <eos>
<sos> plodding towards their goal  <eos>
<sos> he turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries  drew a gold watch from <eos>
<sos> his fob and held it at its chain is length  <eos>
<sos>  can you send them by tram  now  <eos>
<sos> a darkbacked figure under merchants  arch scanned books on the hawker is <eos>
<sos> cart  <eos>

<sos> blazes boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her  <eos>
<sos>  send it at once  will you  he said  it is for an invalid  <eos>
<sos>  yes  sir  i will  sir  <eos>
<sos> blazes boylan rattled merry money in his trousers  pocket  <eos>
<sos>  what is the damage  he asked  <eos>
<sos> the blond girl is slim fingers reckoned the fruits  <eos>
<sos> blazes boylan looked into the cut of her blouse  a young pullet  he <eos>
<sos> took a red carnation from the tall stemglass  <eos>
<sos>  this for me  he asked gallantly  <eos>
<sos> the blond girl glanced sideways at him  got up regardless  with his tie <eos>
<sos> a bit crooked  blushing  <eos>
<sos>  yes  sir  she said  <eos>
<sos> bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches  <eos>
<sos> blazes boylan looked in her blouse with more favour  the stalk of the <eos>
<sos> red flower between his smiling teeth  <eos>
<sos>  may i say a word to your telephone  missy  he asked roguishly  <eos>
<sos>  ma  almidano artifoni said  <eos>
<sos> he gazed over stephen is shoulder at goldsmith is knobby poll  <eos>
<sos> two carfuls of tourists passed slowly  their women sitting fore  <eos>
<sos> gripping the handrests  palefaces  men is arms frankly round their <eos>
<sos> stunted forms  they looked from trinity to the blind columned porch of <eos>
<sos> the bank of ireland where pigeons roocoocooed  <eos>
<sos>  anch io ho avuto di queste idee  almidano artifoni said  _quand  ero <eos>
<sos> giovine come lei  eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia  è <eos>
<sos> peccato  perchè la sua voce    sarebbe un cespite di rendita  via  <eos>
<sos> invece  lei si sacrifica _ <eos>
<sos>  sacrifizio incruento  stephen said smiling  swaying his ashplant in <eos>
<sos> slow swingswong from its midpoint  lightly  <eos>
<sos>  speriamo  the round mustachioed face said pleasantly  _ma  dia retta <eos>
<sos> a me  ci rifletta_  <eos>
<sos> by the stern stone hand of grattan  bidding halt  an inchicore tram <eos>
<sos> unloaded straggling highland soldiers of a band  <eos>
<sos>  ci rifletterò  stephen said  glancing down the solid trouserleg  <eos>
<sos>  ma  sul serio  eh  almidano artifoni said  <eos>
<sos> his heavy hand took stephen is firmly  human eyes  they gazed curiously <eos>
<sos> an instant and turned quickly towards a dalkey tram  <eos>
<sos>  eccolo  almidano artifoni said in friendly haste  _venga a trovarmi <eos>
<sos> e ci pensi  addio  caro _ <eos>
<sos>  arrivederla  maestro  stephen said  raising his hat when his hand <eos>

<sos>  but wait till i tell you  he said  delahunt of camden street had the <eos>
<sos> catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher  bloom and the wife <eos>
<sos> were there  lashings of stuff we put up  port wine and sherry and <eos>

<sos>  i was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time  <eos>
<sos> know what i mean  <eos>
<sos> his hands moulded ample curves of air  he shut his eyes tight in <eos>
<sos> delight  his body shrinking  and blew a sweet chirp from his lips  <eos>
<sos>  the lad stood to attention anyhow  he said with a sigh  she is a gamey <eos>
<sos> mare and no mistake  bloom was pointing out all the stars and the <eos>
<sos> comets in the heavens to chris callinan and the jarvey  the great bear <eos>
<sos> and hercules and the dragon  and the whole jingbang lot  but  by god  i <eos>

<sos> poldy  says she  by god  she had bloom cornered  that one  is it _ <eos>
<sos> says chris callinan  sure that is only what you might call a pinprick  <eos>
<sos> by god  he was not far wide of the mark  <eos>
<sos> lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall  panting with soft <eos>
<sos> laughter  <eos>
<sos>  i am weak  he gasped  <eos>
<sos> m coy is white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave  lenehan <eos>
<sos> walked on again  he lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead <eos>
<sos> rapidly  he glanced sideways in the sunlight at m coy  <eos>
<sos>  he is a cultured allroundman  bloom is  he said seriously  he is not one <eos>
<sos> of your common or garden    you know    there is a touch of the artist <eos>
<sos> about old bloom  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom turned over idly pages of _the awful disclosures of maria <eos>
<sos> monk  then of aristotle is masterpiece _ crooked botched print  <eos>
<sos> plates  infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of <eos>
<sos> slaughtered cows  lots of them like that at this moment all over the <eos>
<sos> world  all butting with their skulls to get out of it  child born every <eos>
<sos> minute somewhere  mrs purefoy  <eos>

<sos> ghetto_ by leopold von sacher masoch  <eos>
<sos>  that i had  he said  pushing it by  <eos>
<sos> the shopman let two volumes fall on the counter  <eos>
<sos>  them are two good ones  he said  <eos>
<sos> onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth  <eos>
<sos> he bent to make a bundle of the other books  hugged them against his <eos>
<sos> unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain  <eos>
<sos> on o connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay <eos>
<sos> apparel of mr denis j maginni  professor of dancing  c  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom  alone  looked at the titles  fair tyrants by james <eos>

<sos> _ all the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on <eos>
<sos> wondrous gowns and costliest frillies  for him  for raoul _ <eos>
<sos> yes  this  here  try  <eos>

<sos> felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé _ <eos>
<sos> yes  take this  the end  <eos>
<sos>  you are late  he spoke hoarsely  eying her with a suspicious glare  <eos>
<sos> the beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap  displaying her <eos>
<sos> queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint  an imperceptible smile played <eos>
<sos> round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom read again  the beautiful woman  <eos>
<sos> warmth showered gently over him  cowing his flesh  flesh yielded amply <eos>
<sos> amid rumpled clothes  whites of eyes swooning up  his nostrils arched <eos>
<sos> themselves for prey  melting breast ointments  for him  for raoul    <eos>
<sos> armpits  oniony sweat  fishgluey slime  her heaving embonpoint    <eos>

<sos> phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop  bulging out the dingy <eos>
<sos> curtains  the shopman is uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven <eos>
<sos> reddened face  coughing  he raked his throat rudely  puked phlegm on <eos>
<sos> the floor  he put his boot on what he had spat  wiping his sole along <eos>
<sos> it  and bent  showing a rawskinned crown  scantily haired  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom beheld it  <eos>
<sos> mastering his troubled breath  he said  <eos>
<sos>  i ll take this one  <eos>
<sos> the shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum  <eos>
<sos>  sweets of sin  he said  tapping on it  that is a good one  <eos>
<sos> the lacquey by the door of dillon is auctionrooms shook his handbell <eos>
<sos> twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet  <eos>
<sos> dilly dedalus  loitering by the curbstone  heard the beats of the bell  <eos>
<sos> the cries of the auctioneer within  four and nine  those lovely <eos>
<sos> curtains  five shillings  cosy curtains  selling new at two guineas  <eos>
<sos> any advance on five shillings  going for five shillings  <eos>
<sos> the lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it  <eos>

<sos> j  a  jackson  w  e  wylie  a  munro and h  t  gahan  their stretched <eos>
<sos> necks wagging  negotiated the curve by the college library  <eos>
<sos> mr dedalus  tugging a long moustache  came round from williams is row  <eos>

<sos>  it is time for you  she said  <eos>

<sos> held them back  <eos>
<sos>  stand up straight  girl  he said  you ll get curvature of the spine  <eos>
<sos> do you know what you look like  <eos>
<sos> he let his head sink suddenly down and forward  hunching his shoulders <eos>
<sos> and dropping his underjaw  <eos>
<sos>  give it up  father  dilly said  all the people are looking at you  <eos>
<sos> mr dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache  <eos>
<sos>  did you get any money  dilly asked  <eos>

<sos> would lend me fourpence  <eos>

<sos> he left her and walked on  dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat  <eos>
<sos>  well  what is it  he said  stopping  <eos>
<sos> the lacquey rang his bell behind their backs  <eos>
<sos>  barang  <eos>
<sos>  curse your bloody blatant soul  mr dedalus cried  turning on him  <eos>
<sos> the lacquey  aware of comment  shook the lolling clapper of his bell <eos>
<sos> but feebly  <eos>
<sos>  bang  <eos>
<sos> mr dedalus stared at him  <eos>
<sos>  watch him  he said  it is instructive  i wonder will he allow us to <eos>

<sos> the viceregal cavalcade passed  greeted by obsequious policemen  out of <eos>
<sos> parkgate  <eos>
<sos>  i am sure you have another shilling  dilly said  <eos>
<sos> the lacquey banged loudly  <eos>
<sos> mr dedalus amid the din walked off  murmuring to himself with a pursing <eos>
<sos> mincing mouth gently  <eos>

<sos> two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance  <eos>

<sos> waiting for ben dollard  he is going to say a word to long john to get <eos>
<sos> him to take those two men off  all i want is a little time  <eos>
<sos> he looked with vague hope up and down the quay  a big apple bulging in <eos>
<sos> his neck  <eos>
<sos>  i know  mr dedalus said  nodding  poor old bockedy ben  he is always <eos>
<sos> doing a good turn for someone  hold hard  <eos>
<sos> he put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant  <eos>
<sos>  there he is  by god  he said  arse and pockets  <eos>
<sos> ben dollard is loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops <eos>
<sos> crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge  he came towards <eos>
<sos> them at an amble  scratching actively behind his coattails  <eos>
<sos> as he came near mr dedalus greeted  <eos>
<sos>  hold that fellow with the bad trousers  <eos>
<sos>  hold him now  ben dollard said  <eos>
<sos> mr dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of ben <eos>
<sos> dollard is figure  then  turning to father cowley with a nod  he <eos>
<sos> muttered sneeringly  <eos>
<sos>  that is a pretty garment  is not it  for a summer is day  <eos>
<sos>  why  god eternally curse your soul  ben dollard growled furiously  i <eos>
<sos> threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw  <eos>
<sos> he stood beside them beaming  on them first and on his roomy clothes <eos>
<sos> from points of which mr dedalus flicked fluff  saying  <eos>
<sos>  they were made for a man in his health  ben  anyhow  <eos>
<sos>  bad luck to the jewman that made them  ben dollard said  thanks be to <eos>
<sos> god he is not paid yet  <eos>
<sos>  and how is that basso profondo  benjamin  father cowley asked  <eos>
<sos> cashel boyle o connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell  murmuring  <eos>
<sos> glassyeyed  strode past the kildare street club  <eos>
<sos> ben dollard frowned and  making suddenly a chanter is mouth  gave forth <eos>
<sos> a deep note  <eos>
<sos>  aw  he said  <eos>
<sos>  that is the style  mr dedalus said  nodding to its drone  <eos>
<sos>  what about that  ben dollard said  not too dusty  what  <eos>
<sos> he turned to both  <eos>
<sos>  that ll do  father cowley said  nodding also  <eos>
<sos> the reverend hugh c  love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint <eos>
<sos> mary is abbey past james and charles kennedy is  rectifiers  attended by <eos>
<sos> geraldines tall and personable  towards the tholsel beyond the ford of <eos>
<sos> hurdles  <eos>
<sos> ben dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward  <eos>
<sos> his joyful fingers in the air  <eos>
<sos>  come along with me to the subsheriff is office  he said  i want to show <eos>
<sos> you the new beauty rock has for a bailiff  he is a cross between <eos>
<sos> lobengula and lynchehaun  he is well worth seeing  mind you  come along  <eos>

<sos> cost me a fall if i do not    wait awhile    we re on the right lay  <eos>
<sos> bob  believe you me  <eos>
<sos>  for a few days tell him  father cowley said anxiously  <eos>
<sos> ben dollard halted and stared  his loud orifice open  a dangling button <eos>
<sos> of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the <eos>
<sos> heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright  <eos>
<sos>  what few days  he boomed  has not your landlord distrained for rent  <eos>
<sos>  he has  father cowley said  <eos>
<sos>  then our friend is writ is not worth the paper it is printed on  ben <eos>
<sos> dollard said  the landlord has the prior claim  i gave him all the <eos>
<sos> particulars  29 windsor avenue  love is the name  <eos>
<sos>  that is right  father cowley said  the reverend mr love  he is a <eos>
<sos> minister in the country somewhere  but are you sure of that  <eos>
<sos>  you can tell barabbas from me  ben dollard said  that he can put that <eos>
<sos> writ where jacko put the nuts  <eos>
<sos> he led father cowley boldly forward  linked to his bulk  <eos>
<sos>  filberts i believe they were  mr dedalus said  as he dropped his <eos>
<sos> glasses on his coatfront  following them  <eos>
<sos>  the youngster will be all right  martin cunningham said  as they <eos>
<sos> passed out of the castleyard gate  <eos>
<sos> the policeman touched his forehead  <eos>
<sos>  god bless you  martin cunningham said  cheerily  <eos>
<sos> he signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on <eos>
<sos> towards lord edward street  <eos>
<sos> bronze by gold  miss kennedy is head by miss douce is head  appeared <eos>
<sos> above the crossblind of the ormond hotel  <eos>
<sos>  yes  martin cunningham said  fingering his beard  i wrote to father <eos>
<sos> conmee and laid the whole case before him  <eos>
<sos>  you could try our friend  mr power suggested backward  <eos>
<sos>  boyd  martin cunningham said shortly  touch me not  <eos>
<sos> john wyse nolan  lagging behind  reading the list  came after them <eos>
<sos> quickly down cork hill  <eos>
<sos> on the steps of the city hall councillor nannetti  descending  hailed <eos>
<sos> alderman cowley and councillor abraham lyon ascending  <eos>
<sos> the castle car wheeled empty into upper exchange street  <eos>
<sos>  look here  martin  john wyse nolan said  overtaking them at the mail <eos>
<sos> office  i see bloom put his name down for five shillings  <eos>
<sos>  quite right  martin cunningham said  taking the list  and put down the <eos>
<sos> five shillings too  <eos>
<sos>  without a second word either  mr power said  <eos>
<sos>  strange but true  martin cunningham added  <eos>
<sos> john wyse nolan opened wide eyes  <eos>
<sos>  i ll say there is much kindness in the jew  he quoted  elegantly  <eos>
<sos> they went down parliament street  <eos>
<sos>  there is jimmy henry  mr power said  just heading for kavanagh is  <eos>
<sos>  righto  martin cunningham said  here goes  <eos>
<sos> outside la maison claire blazes boylan waylaid jack mooney is <eos>
<sos> brother in law  humpy  tight  making for the liberties  <eos>
<sos> john wyse nolan fell back with mr power  while martin cunningham took <eos>
<sos> the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit  who walked <eos>
<sos> uncertainly  with hasty steps past micky anderson is watches  <eos>
<sos>  the assistant town clerk is corns are giving him some trouble  john <eos>
<sos> wyse nolan told mr power  <eos>
<sos> they followed round the corner towards james kavanagh is winerooms  the <eos>
<sos> empty castle car fronted them at rest in essex gate  martin cunningham  <eos>
<sos> speaking always  showed often the list at which jimmy henry did not <eos>
<sos> glance  <eos>
<sos>  and long john fanning is here too  john wyse nolan said  as large as <eos>
<sos> life  <eos>
<sos> the tall form of long john fanning filled the doorway where he stood  <eos>
<sos>  good day  mr subsheriff  martin cunningham said  as all halted and <eos>
<sos> greeted  <eos>
<sos> long john fanning made no way for them  he removed his large henry clay <eos>
<sos> decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all <eos>
<sos> their faces  <eos>
<sos>  are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations  he <eos>
<sos> said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk  <eos>
<sos> hell open to christians they were having  jimmy henry said pettishly  <eos>
<sos> about their damned irish language  where was the marshal  he wanted to <eos>
<sos> know  to keep order in the council chamber  and old barlow the <eos>
<sos> macebearer laid up with asthma  no mace on the table  nothing in order  <eos>
<sos> no quorum even  and hutchinson  the lord mayor  in llandudno and little <eos>
<sos> lorcan sherlock doing locum tenens for him  damned irish language  <eos>
<sos> language of our forefathers  <eos>
<sos> long john fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips  <eos>
<sos> martin cunningham spoke by turns  twirling the peak of his beard  to <eos>
<sos> the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff  while john wyse nolan held <eos>
<sos> his peace  <eos>
<sos>  what dignam was that  long john fanning asked  <eos>
<sos> jimmy henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot  <eos>
<sos>  o  my corns  he said plaintively  come upstairs for goodness  sake <eos>
<sos> till i sit down somewhere  uff  ooo  mind  <eos>
<sos> testily he made room for himself beside long john fanning is flank and <eos>
<sos> passed in and up the stairs  <eos>
<sos>  come on up  martin cunningham said to the subsheriff  i do not think <eos>
<sos> you knew him or perhaps you did  though  <eos>
<sos> with john wyse nolan mr power followed them in  <eos>
<sos>  decent little soul he was  mr power said to the stalwart back of long <eos>
<sos> john fanning ascending towards long john fanning in the mirror  <eos>
<sos>  rather lowsized  dignam of menton is office that was  martin cunningham <eos>
<sos> said  <eos>
<sos> long john fanning could not remember him  <eos>
<sos> clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air  <eos>
<sos>  what is that  martin cunningham said  <eos>
<sos> all turned where they stood  john wyse nolan came down again  from the <eos>
<sos> cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass parliament street  <eos>
<sos> harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering  gaily they went <eos>
<sos> past before his cool unfriendly eyes  not quickly  in saddles of the <eos>
<sos> leaders  leaping leaders  rode outriders  <eos>
<sos>  what was it  martin cunningham asked  as they went on up the <eos>
<sos> staircase  <eos>
<sos>  the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of ireland  john wyse <eos>
<sos> nolan answered from the stairfoot  <eos>
<sos> as they trod across the thick carpet buck mulligan whispered behind his <eos>
<sos> panama to haines  <eos>
<sos>  parnell is brother  there in the corner  <eos>
<sos> they chose a small table near the window  opposite a longfaced man <eos>
<sos> whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard  <eos>
<sos>  is that he  haines asked  twisting round in his seat  <eos>
<sos>  yes  mulligan said  that is john howard  his brother  our city marshal  <eos>
<sos> john howard parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw <eos>
<sos> went up again to his forehead whereat it rested  an instant after  <eos>
<sos> under its screen  his eyes looked quickly  ghostbright  at his foe and <eos>
<sos> fell once more upon a working corner  <eos>
<sos>  i ll take a mélange  haines said to the waitress  <eos>
<sos>  two mélanges  buck mulligan said  and bring us some scones and <eos>
<sos> butter and some cakes as well  <eos>
<sos> when she had gone he said  laughing  <eos>
<sos>  we call it d b c  because they have damn bad cakes  o  but you missed <eos>
<sos> dedalus on hamlet  <eos>
<sos> haines opened his newbought book  <eos>
<sos>  i am sorry  he said  shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all <eos>
<sos> minds that have lost their balance  <eos>
<sos> the onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 nelson street  <eos>
<sos>  england expects    <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan is primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter  <eos>
<sos>  you should see him  he said  when his body loses its balance  <eos>
<sos> wandering ængus i call him  <eos>
<sos>  i am sure he has an idée fixe  haines said  pinching his chin <eos>
<sos> thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger  now i am speculating what it <eos>
<sos> would be likely to be  such persons always have  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan bent across the table gravely  <eos>
<sos>  they drove his wits astray  he said  by visions of hell  he will never <eos>
<sos> capture the attic note  the note of swinburne  of all poets  the white <eos>
<sos> death and the ruddy birth  that is his tragedy  he can never be a poet  <eos>
<sos> the joy of creation    <eos>
<sos>  eternal punishment  haines said  nodding curtly  i see  i tackled him <eos>
<sos> this morning on belief  there was something on his mind  i saw  it is <eos>
<sos> rather interesting because professor pokorny of vienna makes an <eos>
<sos> interesting point out of that  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan is watchful eyes saw the waitress come  he helped her to <eos>
<sos> unload her tray  <eos>
<sos>  he can find no trace of hell in ancient irish myth  haines said  amid <eos>
<sos> the cheerful cups  the moral idea seems lacking  the sense of destiny  <eos>
<sos> of retribution  rather strange he should have just that fixed idea  <eos>
<sos> does he write anything for your movement  <eos>
<sos> he sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream  <eos>
<sos> buck mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over <eos>
<sos> its smoking pith  he bit off a soft piece hungrily  <eos>
<sos>  ten years  he said  chewing and laughing  he is going to write <eos>
<sos> something in ten years  <eos>
<sos>  seems a long way off  haines said  thoughtfully lifting his spoon  <eos>
<sos> still  i should not wonder if he did after all  <eos>
<sos> he tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup  <eos>
<sos>  this is real irish cream i take it  he said with forbearance  i do not <eos>
<sos> want to be imposed on  <eos>
<sos> elijah  skiff  light crumpled throwaway  sailed eastward by flanks of <eos>
<sos> ships and trawlers  amid an archipelago of corks  beyond new wapping <eos>
<sos> street past benson is ferry  and by the threemasted schooner rosevean <eos>
<sos> from bridgwater with bricks  <eos>
<sos> almidano artifoni walked past holles street  past sewell is yard  behind <eos>
<sos> him cashel boyle o connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell  with <eos>
<sos> stickumbrelladustcoat dangling  shunned the lamp before mr law smith is <eos>
<sos> house and  crossing  walked along merrion square  distantly behind him <eos>
<sos> a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of college park  <eos>
<sos> cashel boyle o connor fitzmaurice tisdall farrell walked as far as mr <eos>
<sos> lewis werner is cheerful windows  then turned and strode back along <eos>
<sos> merrion square  his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling  <eos>
<sos> at the corner of wilde is house he halted  frowned at elijah is name <eos>
<sos> announced on the metropolitan hall  frowned at the distant pleasance of <eos>
<sos> duke is lawn  his eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun  with ratsteeth <eos>
<sos> bared he muttered  <eos>
<sos>  coactus volui  <eos>
<sos> he strode on for clare street  grinding his fierce word  <eos>
<sos> as he strode past mr bloom is dental windows the sway of his dustcoat <eos>
<sos> brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards  <eos>
<sos> having buffeted a thewless body  the blind stripling turned his sickly <eos>
<sos> face after the striding form  <eos>
<sos>  god is curse on you  he said sourly  whoever you are  you re blinder <eos>
<sos> nor i am  you bitch is bastard  <eos>
<sos> opposite ruggy o donohoe is master patrick aloysius dignam  pawing the <eos>
<sos> pound and a half of mangan is  late fehrenbach is  porksteaks he had been <eos>

<sos> macdowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping <eos>
<sos> sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle barney brought from tunney is  <eos>
<sos> and they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake  jawing the whole <eos>
<sos> blooming time and sighing  <eos>
<sos> after wicklow lane the window of madame doyle  courtdress milliner  <eos>
<sos> stopped him  he stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their <eos>
<sos> pelts and putting up their props  from the sidemirrors two mourning <eos>
<sos> masters dignam gaped silently  myler keogh  dublin is pet lamb  will <eos>
<sos> meet sergeantmajor bennett  the portobello bruiser  for a purse of <eos>
<sos> fifty sovereigns  gob  that d be a good pucking match to see  myler <eos>

<sos> dignam on his left turned as he turned  that is me in mourning  when is <eos>
<sos> it  may the twentysecond  sure  the blooming thing is all over  he <eos>
<sos> turned to the right and on his right master dignam turned  his cap <eos>
<sos> awry  his collar sticking up  buttoning it down  his chin lifted  he <eos>
<sos> saw the image of marie kendall  charming soubrette  beside the two <eos>
<sos> puckers  one of them mots that do be in the packets of fags stoer <eos>
<sos> smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found <eos>
<sos> out  <eos>
<sos> master dignam got his collar down and dawdled on  the best pucker going <eos>
<sos> for strength was fitzsimons  one puck in the wind from that fellow <eos>
<sos> would knock you into the middle of next week  man  but the best pucker <eos>
<sos> for science was jem corbet before fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out <eos>
<sos> of him  dodging and all  <eos>
<sos> in grafton street master dignam saw a red flower in a toff is mouth and <eos>
<sos> a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was <eos>
<sos> telling him and grinning all the time  <eos>
<sos> no sandymount tram  <eos>
<sos> master dignam walked along nassau street  shifted the porksteaks to his <eos>

<sos> pasturelands of lusk and rush and carrickmines and from the streamy <eos>
<sos> vales of thomond  from the m gillicuddy is reeks the inaccessible and <eos>
<sos> lordly shannon the unfathomable  and from the gentle declivities of the <eos>

<sos> of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer is firkins <eos>
<sos> and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great <eos>
<sos> hundreds  various in size  the agate with this dun  <eos>
<sos> so we turned into barney kiernan is and there  sure enough  was the <eos>
<sos> citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that <eos>
<sos> bloody mangy mongrel  garryowen  and he waiting for what the sky would <eos>
<sos> drop in the way of drink  <eos>
<sos>  there he is  says i  in his gloryhole  with his cruiskeen lawn and his <eos>
<sos> load of papers  working for the cause  <eos>
<sos> the bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps  <eos>
<sos> be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that <eos>
<sos> bloody dog  i am told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off <eos>
<sos> a constabulary man in santry that came round one time with a blue paper <eos>
<sos> about a licence  <eos>
<sos>  stand and deliver  says he  <eos>
<sos>  that is all right  citizen  says joe  friends here  <eos>
<sos>  pass  friends  says he  <eos>
<sos> then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he  <eos>
<sos>  what is your opinion of the times  <eos>
<sos> doing the rapparee and rory of the hill  but  begob  joe was equal to <eos>
<sos> the occasion  <eos>
<sos>  i think the markets are on a rise  says he  sliding his hand down his <eos>
<sos> fork  <eos>
<sos> so begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says  <eos>
<sos>  foreign wars is the cause of it  <eos>
<sos> and says joe  sticking his thumb in his pocket  <eos>
<sos>  it is the russians wish to tyrannise  <eos>
<sos>  arrah  give over your bloody codding  joe  says i  i ve a thirst on me <eos>
<sos> i would not sell for half a crown  <eos>

<sos> he  <eos>
<sos>  never better  a chara  says he  what garry  are we going to win  eh  <eos>
<sos> and with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck <eos>
<sos> and  by jesus  he near throttled him  <eos>
<sos> the figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was <eos>
<sos> that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired <eos>
<sos> freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded <eos>
<sos> deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed <eos>
<sos> hero  from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his <eos>
<sos> rocklike mountainous knees were covered  as was likewise the rest of <eos>
<sos> his body wherever visible  with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair <eos>
<sos> in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse  ulex europeus   <eos>
<sos> the widewinged nostrils  from which bristles of the same tawny hue <eos>
<sos> projected  were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous <eos>
<sos> obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest  the eyes in <eos>
<sos> which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the <eos>
<sos> dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower  a powerful current of warm <eos>
<sos> breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his <eos>
<sos> mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations <eos>
<sos> of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground  the <eos>
<sos> summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to <eos>
<sos> vibrate and tremble  <eos>
<sos> he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to <eos>
<sos> the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a <eos>
<sos> girdle of plaited straw and rushes  beneath this he wore trews of <eos>
<sos> deerskin  roughly stitched with gut  his nether extremities were <eos>
<sos> encased in high balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple  the feet <eos>
<sos> being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of <eos>
<sos> the same beast  from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled <eos>

<sos> supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which <eos>
<sos> his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a <eos>
<sos> mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone  <eos>
<sos> so anyhow terry brought the three pints joe was standing and begob the <eos>
<sos> sight nearly left my eyes when i saw him land out a quid  o  as true as <eos>

<sos> swiftly in  radiant as the eye of heaven  a comely youth and behind him <eos>
<sos> there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance  bearing the sacred <eos>
<sos> scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage  <eos>
<sos> fairest of her race  <eos>
<sos> little alf bergan popped in round the door and hid behind barney is <eos>
<sos> snug  squeezed up with the laughing  and who was sitting up there in <eos>
<sos> the corner that i had not seen snoring drunk blind to the world only bob <eos>
<sos> doran  i did not know what was up and alf kept making signs out of the <eos>

<sos>  who are you laughing at  says bob doran  is that bergan  <eos>
<sos>  hurry up  terry boy  says alf  <eos>
<sos> terence o ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full <eos>
<sos> of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers bungiveagh and <eos>
<sos> bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats  cunning as the sons of <eos>
<sos> deathless leda  for they garner the succulent berries of the hop and <eos>
<sos> mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour <eos>
<sos> juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day <eos>
<sos> from their toil  those cunning brothers  lords of the vat  <eos>
<sos> then did you  chivalrous terence  hand forth  as to the manner born  <eos>
<sos> that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that <eos>
<sos> thirsted  the soul of chivalry  in beauty akin to the immortals  <eos>
<sos> but he  the young chief of the o bergan is  could ill brook to be <eos>
<sos> outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a <eos>
<sos> testoon of costliest bronze  thereon embossed in excellent smithwork <eos>
<sos> was seen the image of a queen of regal port  scion of the house of <eos>
<sos> brunswick  victoria her name  her most excellent majesty  by grace of <eos>
<sos> god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland and of the <eos>
<sos> british dominions beyond the sea  queen  defender of the faith  empress <eos>
<sos> of india  even she  who bore rule  a victress over many peoples  the <eos>
<sos> wellbeloved  for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to <eos>
<sos> the going down thereof  the pale  the dark  the ruddy and the ethiop  <eos>
<sos>  what is that bloody freemason doing  says the citizen  prowling up and <eos>
<sos> down outside  <eos>
<sos>  what is that  says joe  <eos>
<sos>  here you are  says alf  chucking out the rhino  talking about hanging  <eos>
<sos> i ll show you something you never saw  hangmen is letters  look at here  <eos>
<sos> so he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his <eos>
<sos> pocket  <eos>
<sos>  are you codding  says i  <eos>
<sos>  honest injun  says alf  read them  <eos>
<sos> so joe took up the letters  <eos>
<sos>  who are you laughing at  says bob doran  <eos>
<sos> so i saw there was going to be a bit of a dust  bob is a queer chap when <eos>
<sos> the porter is up in him so says i just to make talk  <eos>
<sos>  how is willy murray those times  alf  <eos>

<sos>  paddy dignam dead  says alf  <eos>
<sos>  ay  says joe  <eos>
<sos>  sure i am after seeing him not five minutes ago  says alf  as plain as <eos>
<sos> a pikestaff  <eos>
<sos>  who is dead  says bob doran  <eos>
<sos>  you saw his ghost then  says joe  god between us and harm  <eos>
<sos>  what  says alf  good christ  only five    what     and willy murray <eos>
<sos> with him  the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim is    what  dignam <eos>
<sos> dead  <eos>
<sos>  what about dignam  says bob doran  who is talking about     <eos>
<sos>  dead  says alf  he is no more dead than you are  <eos>
<sos>  maybe so  says joe  they took the liberty of burying him this morning <eos>
<sos> anyhow  <eos>
<sos>  paddy  says alf  <eos>
<sos>  ay  says joe  he paid the debt of nature  god be merciful to him  <eos>
<sos>  good christ  says alf  <eos>
<sos> begob he was what you might call flabbergasted  <eos>
<sos> in the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by <eos>
<sos> tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing <eos>
<sos> luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible  the apparition of <eos>
<sos> the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge <eos>
<sos> of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face  communication was <eos>
<sos> effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the <eos>
<sos> orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar <eos>
<sos> plexus  questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the <eos>
<sos> heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return <eos>
<sos> but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty <eos>
<sos> entities on the lower astral levels  in reply to a question as to his <eos>
<sos> first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously <eos>
<sos> he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had <eos>
<sos> summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them  <eos>
<sos> interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the <eos>
<sos> flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the <eos>
<sos> spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort <eos>
<sos> such as tālāfānā  ālāvātār  hātākāldā  wātāklāsāt and that the highest <eos>
<sos> adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature  <eos>
<sos> having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently <eos>
<sos> afforded relief  asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted <eos>
<sos> all who were still at the wrong side of māyā to acknowledge the true <eos>
<sos> path for it was reported in devanic circles that mars and jupiter were <eos>
<sos> out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power  it was <eos>
<sos> then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the <eos>
<sos> defunct and the reply was  _we greet you  friends of earth  who are <eos>
<sos> still in the body  mind c  k  does not pile it on _ it was ascertained <eos>
<sos> that the reference was to mr cornelius kelleher  manager of messrs h  <eos>
<sos> j  o neill is popular funeral establishment  a personal friend of the <eos>
<sos> defunct  who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment <eos>
<sos> arrangements  before departing he requested that it should be told to <eos>
<sos> his dear son patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for <eos>
<sos> was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair <eos>
<sos> should be sent to cullen is to be soled only as the heels were still <eos>
<sos> good  he stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in <eos>
<sos> the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made <eos>
<sos> known  <eos>
<sos> assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was <eos>
<sos> intimated that this had given satisfaction  <eos>
<sos> he is gone from mortal haunts  o dignam  sun of our morning  fleet was <eos>
<sos> his foot on the bracken  patrick of the beamy brow  wail  banba  with <eos>
<sos> your wind  and wail  o ocean  with your whirlwind  <eos>
<sos>  there he is again  says the citizen  staring out  <eos>
<sos>  who  says i  <eos>
<sos>  bloom  says he  he is on point duty up and down there for the last ten <eos>
<sos> minutes  <eos>
<sos> and  begob  i saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again  <eos>
<sos> little alf was knocked bawways  faith  he was  <eos>
<sos>  good christ  says he  i could have sworn it was him  <eos>
<sos> and says bob doran  with the hat on the back of his poll  lowest <eos>
<sos> blackguard in dublin when he is under the influence  <eos>
<sos>  who said christ is good  <eos>
<sos>  i beg your parsnips  says alf  <eos>
<sos>  is that a good christ  says bob doran  to take away poor little willy <eos>
<sos> dignam  <eos>
<sos>  ah  well  says alf  trying to pass it off  he is over all his troubles  <eos>
<sos> but bob doran shouts out of him  <eos>
<sos>  he is a bloody ruffian  i say  to take away poor little willy dignam  <eos>
<sos> terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet  that they did not <eos>
<sos> want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises  and bob <eos>
<sos> doran starts doing the weeps about paddy dignam  true as you re there  <eos>
<sos>  the finest man  says he  snivelling  the finest purest character  <eos>
<sos> the tear is bloody near your eye  talking through his bloody hat  <eos>
<sos> fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married  <eos>
<sos> mooney  the bumbailiff is daughter  mother kept a kip in hardwicke <eos>
<sos> street  that used to be stravaging about the landings bantam lyons told <eos>
<sos> me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on <eos>
<sos> her  exposing her person  open to all comers  fair field and no favour  <eos>
<sos>  the noblest  the truest  says he  and he is gone  poor little willy  <eos>
<sos> poor little paddy dignam  <eos>
<sos> and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that <eos>
<sos> beam of heaven  <eos>
<sos> old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round <eos>
<sos> the door  <eos>
<sos>  come in  come on  he wo not eat you  says the citizen  <eos>
<sos> so bloom slopes in with his cod is eye on the dog and he asks terry was <eos>
<sos> martin cunningham there  <eos>
<sos>  o  christ m keown  says joe  reading one of the letters  listen to <eos>
<sos> this  will you  <eos>
<sos> and he starts reading out one  <eos>
<sos> _7 hunter street  <eos>
<sos> liverpool _ <eos>
<sos> _to the high sheriff of dublin  <eos>
<sos> dublin _ <eos>
<sos> _honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful <eos>
<sos> case i hanged joe gann in bootle jail on the 12 of febuary 1900 and i <eos>
<sos> hanged   _ <eos>
<sos>  show us  joe  says i  <eos>
<sos>  _    private arthur chace for fowl murder of jessie tilsit in <eos>
<sos> pentonville prison and i was assistant when   _ <eos>
<sos>  jesus  says i  <eos>
<sos>      billington executed the awful murderer toad smith    <eos>
<sos> the citizen made a grab at the letter  <eos>
<sos>  hold hard  says joe  _i have a special nack of putting the noose once <eos>
<sos> in he ca not get out hoping to be favoured i remain  honoured sir  my <eos>
<sos> terms is five ginnees _ <eos>
<sos> _h  rumbold  <eos>
<sos> master barber _ <eos>
<sos>  and a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too  says the citizen  <eos>
<sos>  and the dirty scrawl of the wretch  says joe  here  says he  take them <eos>
<sos> to hell out of my sight  alf  hello  bloom  says he  what will you <eos>
<sos> have  <eos>
<sos> so they started arguing about the point  bloom saying he would not and <eos>
<sos> he could not and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said <eos>
<sos> well he d just take a cigar  gob  he is a prudent member and no mistake  <eos>
<sos>  give us one of your prime stinkers  terry  says joe  <eos>
<sos> and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with <eos>
<sos> a black border round it  <eos>
<sos>  they re all barbers  says he  from the black country that would hang <eos>
<sos> their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses  <eos>
<sos> and he was telling us there is two fellows waiting below to pull his <eos>
<sos> heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they <eos>
<sos> chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull  <eos>
<sos> in the dark land they bide  the vengeful knights of the razor  their <eos>
<sos> deadly coil they grasp  yea  and therein they lead to erebus whatsoever <eos>
<sos> wight hath done a deed of blood for i will on nowise suffer it even so <eos>
<sos> saith the lord  <eos>
<sos> so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom <eos>
<sos> comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the <eos>
<sos> business and the old dog smelling him all the time i am told those <eos>
<sos> jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about <eos>
<sos> i do not know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on  <eos>
<sos>  there is one thing it has not a deterrent effect on  says alf  <eos>
<sos>  what is that  says joe  <eos>
<sos>  the poor bugger is tool that is being hanged  says alf  <eos>
<sos>  that so  says joe  <eos>
<sos>  god is truth  says alf  i heard that from the head warder that was in <eos>
<sos> kilmainham when they hanged joe brady  the invincible  he told me when <eos>
<sos> they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like <eos>
<sos> a poker  <eos>
<sos>  ruling passion strong in death  says joe  as someone said  <eos>
<sos>  that can be explained by science  says bloom  it is only a natural <eos>
<sos> phenomenon  do not you see  because on account of the    <eos>
<sos> and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science <eos>
<sos> and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon  <eos>
<sos> the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered <eos>
<sos> medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the <eos>
<sos> cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would  <eos>
<sos> according to the best approved tradition of medical science  be <eos>
<sos> calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent <eos>
<sos> ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus  <eos>
<sos> thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly <eos>
<sos> dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood <eos>
<sos> to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ <eos>
<sos> resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a <eos>
<sos> morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo <eos>
<sos> mortis per diminutionem capitis _ <eos>
<sos> so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and <eos>
<sos> he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard <eos>
<sos> and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe <eos>
<sos> with him about all the fellows that were hanged  drawn and transported <eos>
<sos> for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this  <eos>
<sos> that and the other  talking about new ireland he ought to go and get a <eos>
<sos> new dog so he ought  mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all <eos>
<sos> round the place and scratching his scabs  and round he goes to bob <eos>
<sos> doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could <eos>

<sos> the last farewell was affecting in the extreme  from the belfries far <eos>
<sos> and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the <eos>
<sos> gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums <eos>
<sos> punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance  the deafening <eos>
<sos> claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the <eos>
<sos> ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its <eos>
<sos> supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle  a torrential rain <eos>
<sos> poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared <eos>
<sos> heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest <eos>
<sos> computation five hundred thousand persons  a posse of dublin <eos>
<sos> metropolitan police superintended by the chief commissioner in person <eos>

<sos> pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their <eos>

<sos> quietly  unassumingly rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless <eos>

<sos> cruentus_  he announced his presence by that gentle rumboldian cough <eos>
<sos> which so many have tried  unsuccessfully  to imitate short  painstaking <eos>
<sos> yet withal so characteristic of the man  the arrival of the <eos>
<sos> worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the <eos>
<sos> huge concourse  the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in <eos>
<sos> their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates <eos>
<sos> cheered vociferously in a medley of cries  _hoch  banzai  eljen  zivio  <eos>

<sos> pool of rainwater  his cassock above his hoary head  and offered up to <eos>
<sos> the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication  hard by the block <eos>
<sos> stood the grim figure of the executioner  his visage being concealed in <eos>
<sos> a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which <eos>
<sos> his eyes glowered furiously  as he awaited the fatal signal he tested <eos>
<sos> the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or <eos>
<sos> decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been <eos>
<sos> provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office  on a <eos>

<sos> the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital <eos>
<sos> spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the <eos>
<sos> proceedings from beginning to end but he  with an abnegation rare in <eos>
<sos> these our times  rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying <eos>
<sos> wish  immediately acceded to  that the meal should be divided in <eos>
<sos> aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers  <eos>
<sos> association as a token of his regard and esteem  the nec and _non <eos>
<sos> plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst <eos>
<sos> her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself <eos>
<sos> upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into <eos>
<sos> eternity for her sake  the hero folded her willowy form in a loving <eos>
<sos> embrace murmuring fondly sheila  my own  encouraged by this use of <eos>
<sos> her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable <eos>
<sos> areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her <eos>
<sos> ardour to reach  she swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of <eos>
<sos> their tears that she would ever cherish his memory  that she would <eos>
<sos> never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips <eos>
<sos> as if he were but going to a hurling match in clonturk park  she <eos>
<sos> brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood <eos>
<sos> together on the banks of anna liffey when they had indulged in the <eos>
<sos> innocent pastimes of the young and  oblivious of the dreadful present  <eos>
<sos> they both laughed heartily  all the spectators  including the venerable <eos>
<sos> pastor  joining in the general merriment  that monster audience simply <eos>
<sos> rocked with delight  but anon they were overcome with grief and clasped <eos>
<sos> their hands for the last time  a fresh torrent of tears burst from <eos>
<sos> their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people  touched to the <eos>
<sos> inmost core  broke into heartrending sobs  not the least affected being <eos>
<sos> the aged prebendary himself  big strong men  officers of the peace and <eos>
<sos> genial giants of the royal irish constabulary  were making frank use of <eos>
<sos> their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye <eos>
<sos> in that record assemblage  a most romantic incident occurred when a <eos>
<sos> handsome young oxford graduate  noted for his chivalry towards the fair <eos>
<sos> sex  stepped forward and  presenting his visiting card  bankbook and <eos>
<sos> genealogical tree  solicited the hand of the hapless young lady  <eos>
<sos> requesting her to name the day  and was accepted on the spot  every <eos>
<sos> lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the <eos>
<sos> occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch  a timely and <eos>
<sos> generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion  and when the <eos>
<sos> gallant young oxonian  the bearer  by the way  of one of the most <eos>
<sos> timehonoured names in albion is history  placed on the finger of his <eos>
<sos> blushing fiancée an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in <eos>
<sos> the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds  nay  <eos>
<sos> even the stern provostmarshal  lieutenantcolonel tomkin maxwell <eos>
<sos> ffrenchmullan tomlinson  who presided on the sad occasion  he who had <eos>
<sos> blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without <eos>
<sos> flinching  could not now restrain his natural emotion  with his mailed <eos>
<sos> gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard  by those <eos>
<sos> privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate entourage  to <eos>
<sos> murmur to himself in a faltering undertone  <eos>
<sos>  god blimey if she aint a clinker  that there bleeding tart  blimey it <eos>
<sos> makes me kind of bleeding cry  straight  it does  when i sees her cause <eos>
<sos> i thinks of my old mashtub what is waiting for me down limehouse way  <eos>
<sos> so then the citizen begins talking about the irish language and the <eos>
<sos> corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that ca not speak <eos>
<sos> their own language and joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a <eos>
<sos> quid and bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he <eos>
<sos> cadged off of joe and talking about the gaelic league and the <eos>
<sos> antitreating league and drink  the curse of ireland  antitreating is <eos>
<sos> about the size of it  gob  he d let you pour all manner of drink down <eos>
<sos> his throat till the lord would call him before you d ever see the froth <eos>
<sos> of his pint  and one night i went in with a fellow into one of their <eos>
<sos> musical evenings  song and dance about she could get up on a truss of <eos>
<sos> hay she could my maureen lay and there was a fellow with a ballyhooly <eos>
<sos> blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in irish and a lot of colleen <eos>
<sos> bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and <eos>
<sos> oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns  gob  flahoolagh <eos>
<sos> entertainment  do not be talking  ireland sober is ireland free  and <eos>
<sos> then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers <eos>
<sos> shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of  and one or two <eos>
<sos> sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the <eos>
<sos> females  hitting below the belt  <eos>
<sos> so howandever  as i was saying  the old dog seeing the tin was empty <eos>
<sos> starts mousing around by joe and me  i d train him by kindness  so i <eos>
<sos> would  if he was my dog  give him a rousing fine kick now and again <eos>
<sos> where it would not blind him  <eos>
<sos>  afraid he ll bite you  says the citizen  jeering  <eos>
<sos>  no  says i  but he might take my leg for a lamppost  <eos>
<sos> so he calls the old dog over  <eos>
<sos>  what is on you  garry  says he  <eos>
<sos> then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in irish and the <eos>
<sos> old towser growling  letting on to answer  like a duet in the opera  <eos>
<sos> such growling you never heard as they let off between them  someone <eos>
<sos> that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono <eos>
<sos> publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of <eos>
<sos> that  growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth <eos>
<sos> is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws  <eos>
<sos> all those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the <eos>
<sos> lower animals  and their name is legion  should make a point of not <eos>
<sos> missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the <eos>
<sos> famous old irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet <eos>
<sos> of garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends <eos>
<sos> and acquaintances owen garry  the exhibition  which is the result of <eos>
<sos> years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary <eos>
<sos> system  comprises  among other achievements  the recitation of verse  <eos>
<sos> our greatest living phonetic expert  wild horses shall not drag it from <eos>
<sos> us   has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and <eos>
<sos> compare the verse recited and has found it bears a striking <eos>
<sos> resemblance  the italics are ours  to the ranns of ancient celtic <eos>
<sos> bards  we are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with <eos>
<sos> which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym <eos>
<sos> of the little sweet branch has familiarised the bookloving world but <eos>
<sos> rather  as a contributor d  o  c  points out in an interesting <eos>
<sos> communication published by an evening contemporary  of the harsher and <eos>
<sos> more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the <eos>
<sos> famous raftery and of donal macconsidine to say nothing of a more <eos>
<sos> modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye  we subjoin a <eos>
<sos> specimen which has been rendered into english by an eminent scholar <eos>
<sos> whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we <eos>
<sos> believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more <eos>
<sos> than an indication  the metrical system of the canine original  which <eos>
<sos> recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the welsh <eos>
<sos> englyn  is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will <eos>
<sos> agree that the spirit has been well caught  perhaps it should be added <eos>
<sos> that the effect is greatly increased if owen is verse be spoken somewhat <eos>
<sos> slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour  <eos>
<sos> the curse of my curses <eos>
<sos> seven days every day <eos>
<sos> and seven dry thursdays <eos>
<sos> on you  barney kiernan  <eos>
<sos> has no sup of water <eos>
<sos> to cool my courage  <eos>
<sos> and my guts red roaring <eos>
<sos> after lowry is lights  <eos>
<sos> so he told terry to bring some water for the dog and  gob  you could <eos>
<sos> hear him lapping it up a mile off  and joe asked him would he have <eos>
<sos> another  <eos>
<sos>  i will  says he  a chara  to show there is no ill feeling  <eos>
<sos> gob  he is not as green as he is cabbagelooking  arsing around from one <eos>
<sos> pub to another  leaving it to your own honour  with old giltrap is dog <eos>
<sos> and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators  entertainment for <eos>
<sos> man and beast  and says joe  <eos>
<sos>  could you make a hole in another pint  <eos>
<sos>  could a swim duck  says i  <eos>
<sos>  same again  terry  says joe  are you sure you wo not have anything in <eos>
<sos> the way of liquid refreshment  says he  <eos>
<sos>  thank you  no  says bloom  as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet <eos>
<sos> martin cunningham  do not you see  about this insurance of poor <eos>
<sos> dignam is  martin asked me to go to the house  you see  he  dignam  i <eos>
<sos> mean  did not serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the <eos>
<sos> time and nominally under the act the mortgagee ca not recover on the <eos>
<sos> policy  <eos>
<sos>  holy wars  says joe  laughing  that is a good one if old shylock is <eos>
<sos> landed  so the wife comes out top dog  what  <eos>
<sos>  well  that is a point  says bloom  for the wife is admirers  <eos>
<sos>  whose admirers  says joe  <eos>
<sos>  the wife is advisers  i mean  says bloom  <eos>
<sos> then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act <eos>
<sos> like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit <eos>
<sos> of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that <eos>
<sos> dignam owed bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow <eos>
<sos> contested the mortgagee is right till he near had the head of me addled <eos>
<sos> with his mortgagor under the act  he was bloody safe he was not run in <eos>
<sos> himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a <eos>
<sos> friend in court  selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal <eos>
<sos> hungarian privileged lottery  true as you re there  o  commend me to an <eos>
<sos> israelite  royal and privileged hungarian robbery  <eos>
<sos> so bob doran comes lurching around asking bloom to tell mrs dignam he <eos>
<sos> was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and <eos>
<sos> to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was <eos>
<sos> never a truer  a finer than poor little willy that is dead to tell her  <eos>
<sos> choking with bloody foolery  and shaking bloom is hand doing the tragic <eos>
<sos> to tell her that  shake hands  brother  you re a rogue and i am another  <eos>
<sos>  let me  said he  so far presume upon our acquaintance which  however <eos>
<sos> slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time  is <eos>
<sos> founded  as i hope and believe  on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to <eos>
<sos> request of you this favour  but  should i have overstepped the limits <eos>
<sos> of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my <eos>
<sos> boldness  <eos>
<sos>  no  rejoined the other  i appreciate to the full the motives which <eos>
<sos> actuate your conduct and i shall discharge the office you entrust to me <eos>
<sos> consoled by the reflection that  though the errand be one of sorrow  <eos>
<sos> this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness <eos>
<sos> of the cup  <eos>
<sos>  then suffer me to take your hand  said he  the goodness of your heart  <eos>
<sos> i feel sure  will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the <eos>
<sos> expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose <eos>
<sos> poignancy  were i to give vent to my feelings  would deprive me even of <eos>
<sos> speech  <eos>
<sos> and off with him and out trying to walk straight  boosed at five <eos>
<sos> o clock  night he was near being lagged only paddy leonard knew the <eos>
<sos> bobby  14a  blind to the world up in a shebeen in bride street after <eos>
<sos> closing time  fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard  <eos>
<sos> drinking porter out of teacups  and calling himself a frenchy for the <eos>
<sos> shawls  joseph manuo  and talking against the catholic religion  and he <eos>
<sos> serving mass in adam and eve is when he was young with his eyes shut  <eos>
<sos> who wrote the new testament  and the old testament  and hugging and <eos>
<sos> smugging  and the two shawls killed with the laughing  picking his <eos>
<sos> pockets  the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed <eos>
<sos> and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another  _how is your <eos>
<sos> testament  have you got an old testament _ only paddy was passing <eos>
<sos> there  i tell you what  then see him of a sunday with his little <eos>
<sos> concubine of a wife  and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the <eos>
<sos> chapel with her patent boots on her  no less  and her violets  nice as <eos>
<sos> pie  doing the little lady  jack mooney is sister  and the old <eos>
<sos> prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples  gob  jack <eos>
<sos> made him toe the line  told him if he did not patch up the pot  jesus  <eos>

<sos> field  m  p   the cattle traders  <eos>

<sos> all countries and the idol of his own  <eos>
<sos> so joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and <eos>
<sos> the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen <eos>
<sos> sending them all to the rightabout and bloom coming out with his <eos>
<sos> sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the <eos>

<sos> so off they started about irish sports and shoneen games the like of <eos>
<sos> lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil <eos>
<sos> and building up a nation once again and all to that  and of course <eos>
<sos> bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower is heart <eos>

<sos> straw from the bloody floor and if you said to bloom  _look at  bloom  <eos>
<sos> do you see that straw  that is a straw_  declare to my aunt he d talk <eos>
<sos> about it for an hour so he would and talk steady  <eos>
<sos> a most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _brian <eos>
<sos> o ciarnain is in sraid na bretaine bheag_  under the auspices of <eos>
<sos> sluagh na h eireann  on the revival of ancient gaelic sports and the <eos>
<sos> importance of physical culture  as understood in ancient greece and <eos>
<sos> ancient rome and ancient ireland  for the development of the race  the <eos>
<sos> venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the <eos>
<sos> attendance was of large dimensions  after an instructive discourse by <eos>
<sos> the chairman  a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed  <eos>
<sos> a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high <eos>
<sos> standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the <eos>
<sos> revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient panceltic <eos>
<sos> forefathers  the wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of <eos>
<sos> our old tongue  mr joseph m carthy hynes  made an eloquent appeal for <eos>
<sos> the resuscitation of the ancient gaelic sports and pastimes  practised <eos>
<sos> morning and evening by finn maccool  as calculated to revive the best <eos>
<sos> traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient <eos>
<sos> ages  l  bloom  who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses  <eos>
<sos> having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the <eos>
<sos> discussion to a close  in response to repeated requests and hearty <eos>
<sos> plaudits from all parts of a bumper house  by a remarkably noteworthy <eos>
<sos> rendering of the immortal thomas osborne davis  evergreen verses <eos>
<sos>  happily too familiar to need recalling here  a nation once again in <eos>
<sos> the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without <eos>
<sos> fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself  the irish <eos>
<sos> caruso garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were <eos>
<sos> heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only <eos>
<sos> our citizen can sing it  his superb highclass vocalism  which by its <eos>
<sos> superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation  was <eos>
<sos> vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be <eos>

<sos>  who  blazes  says joe  <eos>
<sos> and says bloom  <eos>
<sos>  what i meant about tennis  for example  is the agility and training <eos>
<sos> the eye  <eos>
<sos>  ay  blazes  says alf  he let out that myler was on the beer to run up <eos>
<sos> the odds and he swatting all the time  <eos>
<sos>  we know him  says the citizen  the traitor is son  we know what put <eos>
<sos> english gold in his pocket  <eos>
<sos>  true for you  says joe  <eos>
<sos> and bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the <eos>
<sos> blood  asking alf  <eos>
<sos>  now  do not you think  bergan  <eos>
<sos>  myler dusted the floor with him  says alf  heenan and sayers was only <eos>
<sos> a bloody fool to it  handed him the father and mother of a beating  see <eos>
<sos> the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping  god  <eos>
<sos> he gave him one last puck in the wind  queensberry rules and all  made <eos>
<sos> him puke what he never ate  <eos>
<sos> it was a historic and a hefty battle when myler and percy were <eos>
<sos> scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns  <eos>
<sos> handicapped as he was by lack of poundage  dublin is pet lamb made up <eos>
<sos> for it by superlative skill in ringcraft  the final bout of fireworks <eos>
<sos> was a gruelling for both champions  the welterweight sergeantmajor had <eos>
<sos> tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which keogh had <eos>
<sos> been receivergeneral of rights and lefts  the artilleryman putting in <eos>
<sos> some neat work on the pet is nose  and myler came on looking groggy  the <eos>
<sos> soldier got to business  leading off with a powerful left jab to which <eos>
<sos> the irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the <eos>
<sos> point of bennett is jaw  the redcoat ducked but the dubliner lifted him <eos>
<sos> with a left hook  the body punch being a fine one  the men came to <eos>
<sos> handigrips  myler quickly became busy and got his man under  the bout <eos>
<sos> ending with the bulkier man on the ropes  myler punishing him  the <eos>
<sos> englishman  whose right eye was nearly closed  took his corner where he <eos>
<sos> was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey <eos>
<sos> and brimful of pluck  confident of knocking out the fistic eblanite in <eos>
<sos> jigtime  it was a fight to a finish and the best man for it  the two <eos>
<sos> fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high  the referee twice <eos>
<sos> cautioned pucking percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his <eos>
<sos> footwork a treat to watch  after a brisk exchange of courtesies during <eos>
<sos> which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from <eos>
<sos> his opponent is mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and <eos>
<sos> landed a terrific left to battling bennett is stomach  flooring him <eos>
<sos> flat  it was a knockout clean and clever  amid tense expectation the <eos>
<sos> portobello bruiser was being counted out when bennett is second ole <eos>
<sos> pfotts wettstein threw in the towel and the santry boy was declared <eos>
<sos> victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the <eos>
<sos> ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight  <eos>

<sos> in the third week after the feastday of the holy and undivided trinity  <eos>
<sos> the daughter of the skies  the virgin moon being then in her first <eos>
<sos> quarter  it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the <eos>
<sos> halls of law  there master courtenay  sitting in his own chamber  gave <eos>
<sos> his rede and master justice andrews  sitting without a jury in the <eos>
<sos> probate court  weighed well and pondered the claim of the first <eos>
<sos> chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and <eos>
<sos> final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of <eos>
<sos> the late lamented jacob halliday  vintner  deceased  versus <eos>
<sos> livingstone  an infant  of unsound mind  and another  and to the solemn <eos>
<sos> court of green street there came sir frederick the falconer  and he sat <eos>
<sos> him there about the hour of five o clock to administer the law of the <eos>
<sos> brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in <eos>
<sos> and for the county of the city of dublin  and there sat with him the <eos>

<sos> well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined <eos>
<sos> between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and <eos>
<sos> true verdict give according to the evidence so help them god and kiss <eos>
<sos> the book  and they rose in their seats  those twelve of iar  and they <eos>
<sos> swore by the name of him who is from everlasting that they would do his <eos>
<sos> rightwiseness  and straightway the minions of the law led forth from <eos>
<sos> their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended <eos>
<sos> in consequence of information received  and they shackled him hand and <eos>
<sos> foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge <eos>
<sos> against him for he was a malefactor  <eos>
<sos>  those are nice things  says the citizen  coming over here to ireland <eos>
<sos> filling the country with bugs  <eos>
<sos> so bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with joe  <eos>
<sos> telling him he need not trouble about that little matter till the first <eos>
<sos> but if he would just say a word to mr crawford  and so joe swore high <eos>
<sos> and holy by this and by that he d do the devil and all  <eos>

<sos> spider is web in the corner behind the barrel  and the citizen scowling <eos>
<sos> after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite <eos>
<sos> and when  <eos>
<sos>  a dishonoured wife  says the citizen  that is what is the cause of all <eos>
<sos> our misfortunes  <eos>

<sos> what did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide <eos>
<sos> about the irish language  <eos>
<sos> o nolan  clad in shining armour  low bending made obeisance to the <eos>
<sos> puissant and high and mighty chief of all erin and did him to wit of <eos>
<sos> that which had befallen  how that the grave elders of the most obedient <eos>
<sos> city  second of the realm  had met them in the tholsel  and there  <eos>
<sos> after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal  had taken <eos>
<sos> solemn counsel whereby they might  if so be it might be  bring once <eos>

<sos> and says lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo  <eos>
<sos>  conspuez les anglais  perfide albion  <eos>
<sos> he said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the <eos>
<sos> medher of dark strong foamy ale and  uttering his tribal slogan _lamh <eos>
<sos> dearg abu_  he drank to the undoing of his foes  a race of mighty <eos>
<sos> valorous heroes  rulers of the waves  who sit on thrones of alabaster <eos>
<sos> silent as the deathless gods  <eos>
<sos>  what is up with you  says i to lenehan  you look like a fellow that had <eos>

<sos> hanging over the bloody paper with alf looking for spicy bits instead <eos>
<sos> of attending to the general public  picture of a butting match  trying <eos>
<sos> to crack their bloody skulls  one chap going for the other with his <eos>
<sos> head down like a bull at a gate  and another one  _black beast burned <eos>
<sos> in omaha  ga_  a lot of deadwood dicks in slouch hats and they firing <eos>
<sos> at a sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under <eos>
<sos> him  gob  they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and <eos>

<sos>  but what about the fighting navy  says ned  that keeps our foes at <eos>
<sos> bay  <eos>
<sos>  i ll tell you what about it  says the citizen  hell upon earth it is  <eos>
<sos> read the revelations that is going on in the papers about flogging on <eos>
<sos> the training ships at portsmouth  a fellow writes that calls himself <eos>
<sos> disgusted one  <eos>
<sos> so he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of <eos>
<sos> tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the <eos>
<sos> parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad <eos>
<sos> brought out  howling for his ma  and they tie him down on the buttend <eos>
<sos> of a gun  <eos>
<sos>  a rump and dozen  says the citizen  was what that old ruffian sir john <eos>
<sos> beresford called it but the modern god is englishman calls it caning on <eos>
<sos> the breech  <eos>
<sos> and says john wyse  <eos>
<sos>   tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance  <eos>
<sos> then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane <eos>
<sos> and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad <eos>
<sos> till he yells meila murder  <eos>
<sos>  that is your glorious british navy  says the citizen  that bosses the <eos>
<sos> earth  the fellows that never will be slaves  with the only hereditary <eos>
<sos> chamber on the face of god is earth and their land in the hands of a <eos>
<sos> dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons  that is the great empire they <eos>
<sos> boast about of drudges and whipped serfs  <eos>
<sos>  on which the sun never rises  says joe  <eos>
<sos>  and the tragedy of it is  says the citizen  they believe it  the <eos>
<sos> unfortunate yahoos believe it  <eos>
<sos> they believe in rod  the scourger almighty  creator of hell upon earth  <eos>
<sos> and in jacky tar  the son of a gun  who was conceived of unholy boast  <eos>
<sos> born of the fighting navy  suffered under rump and dozen  was <eos>
<sos> scarified  flayed and curried  yelled like bloody hell  the third day <eos>
<sos> he arose again from the bed  steered into haven  sitteth on his beamend <eos>
<sos> till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be <eos>
<sos> paid  <eos>
<sos>  but  says bloom  is not discipline the same everywhere  i mean would not <eos>
<sos> it be the same here if you put force against force  <eos>
<sos> did not i tell you  as true as i am drinking this porter if he was at his <eos>
<sos> last gasp he d try to downface you that dying was living  <eos>
<sos>  we ll put force against force  says the citizen  we have our greater <eos>
<sos> ireland beyond the sea  they were driven out of house and home in the <eos>
<sos> black 47  their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid <eos>
<sos> low by the batteringram and the times rubbed its hands and told the <eos>
<sos> whitelivered saxons there would soon be as few irish in ireland as <eos>
<sos> redskins in america  even the grand turk sent us his piastres  but the <eos>
<sos> sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of <eos>
<sos> crops that the british hyenas bought and sold in rio de janeiro  ay  <eos>
<sos> they drove out the peasants in hordes  twenty thousand of them died in <eos>
<sos> the coffinships  but those that came to the land of the free remember <eos>
<sos> the land of bondage  and they will come again and with a vengeance  no <eos>
<sos> cravens  the sons of granuaile  the champions of kathleen ni houlihan  <eos>
<sos>  perfectly true  says bloom  but my point was    <eos>
<sos>  we are a long time waiting for that day  citizen  says ned  since the <eos>
<sos> poor old woman told us that the french were on the sea and landed at <eos>
<sos> killala  <eos>
<sos>  ay  says john wyse  we fought for the royal stuarts that reneged us <eos>
<sos> against the williamites and they betrayed us  remember limerick and the <eos>
<sos> broken treatystone  we gave our best blood to france and spain  the <eos>
<sos> wild geese  fontenoy  eh  and sarsfield and o donnell  duke of tetuan <eos>
<sos> in spain  and ulysses browne of camus that was fieldmarshal to maria <eos>
<sos> teresa  but what did we ever get for it  <eos>

<sos> it is  they were never worth a roasted fart to ireland  are not they <eos>

<sos>  and as for the prooshians and the hanoverians  says joe  have not we <eos>
<sos> had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from george <eos>
<sos> the elector down to the german lad and the flatulent old bitch that is <eos>
<sos> dead  <eos>
<sos> jesus  i had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old <eos>
<sos> one with the winkers on her  blind drunk in her royal palace every <eos>
<sos> night of god  old vic  with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman <eos>
<sos> carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by <eos>
<sos> the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _ehren on the <eos>
<sos> rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper  <eos>
<sos>  well  says j  j  we have edward the peacemaker now  <eos>
<sos>  tell that to a fool  says the citizen  there is a bloody sight more pox <eos>
<sos> than pax about that boyo  edward guelph wettin  <eos>
<sos>  and what do you think  says joe  of the holy boys  the priests and <eos>
<sos> bishops of ireland doing up his room in maynooth in his satanic <eos>
<sos> majesty is racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his <eos>
<sos> jockeys rode  the earl of dublin  no less  <eos>

<sos> his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling <eos>
<sos> about  <eos>
<sos>  persecution  says he  all the history of the world is full of it  <eos>
<sos> perpetuating national hatred among nations  <eos>
<sos>  but do you know what a nation means  says john wyse  <eos>
<sos>  yes  says bloom  <eos>
<sos>  what is it  says john wyse  <eos>
<sos>  a nation  says bloom  a nation is the same people living in the same <eos>
<sos> place  <eos>
<sos>  by god  then  says ned  laughing  if that is so i am a nation for i am <eos>
<sos> living in the same place for the past five years  <eos>

<sos>   13   <eos>
<sos> the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious <eos>
<sos> embrace  far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of <eos>
<sos> all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand  on the proud <eos>
<sos> promontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay  on <eos>
<sos> the weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and  last but not least  on <eos>
<sos> the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the <eos>
<sos> stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a <eos>
<sos> beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man  mary  star of the sea  <eos>
<sos> the three girl friends were seated on the rocks  enjoying the evening <eos>
<sos> scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly  many a time and <eos>
<sos> oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy <eos>
<sos> chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine  cissy <eos>
<sos> caffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and <eos>
<sos> jacky caffrey  two little curlyheaded boys  dressed in sailor suits <eos>
<sos> with caps to match and the name h  m  s  belleisle printed on both  <eos>
<sos> for tommy and jacky caffrey were twins  scarce four years old and very <eos>
<sos> noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little <eos>
<sos> fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them  they <eos>
<sos> were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets  building <eos>
<sos> castles as children do  or playing with their big coloured ball  happy <eos>
<sos> as the day was long  and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to <eos>
<sos> and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with <eos>
<sos> delight  he was but eleven months and nine days old and  though still a <eos>
<sos> tiny toddler  was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words  cissy <eos>
<sos> caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty <eos>
<sos> dimple in his chin  <eos>
<sos>  now  baby  cissy caffrey said  say out big  big  i want a drink of <eos>
<sos> water  <eos>
<sos> and baby prattled after her  <eos>
<sos>  a jink a jink a jawbo  <eos>
<sos> cissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of <eos>
<sos> children  so patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could <eos>
<sos> never be got to take his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that <eos>
<sos> held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown <eos>
<sos> bread with golden syrup on  what a persuasive power that girl had  but <eos>
<sos> to be sure baby boardman was as good as gold  a perfect little dote in <eos>
<sos> his new fancy bib  none of your spoilt beauties  flora macflimsy sort  <eos>
<sos> was cissy caffrey  a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life  <eos>
<sos> always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her <eos>
<sos> cherryripe red lips  a girl lovable in the extreme  and edy boardman <eos>
<sos> laughed too at the quaint language of little brother  <eos>
<sos> but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and <eos>
<sos> master jacky  boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to <eos>
<sos> this golden rule  the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand <eos>
<sos> which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go <eos>
<sos> wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like <eos>
<sos> the martello tower had  but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky <eos>
<sos> was selfwilled too and  true to the maxim that every little irishman is <eos>
<sos> house is his castle  he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose <eos>
<sos> that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and  alas to relate   the <eos>
<sos> coveted castle too  needless to say the cries of discomfited master <eos>
<sos> tommy drew the attention of the girl friends  <eos>
<sos>  come here  tommy  his sister called imperatively  at once  and you  <eos>
<sos> jacky  for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand  wait till i <eos>
<sos> catch you for that  <eos>
<sos> his eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for <eos>
<sos> their big sister is word was law with the twins  and in a sad plight he <eos>
<sos> was too after his misadventure  his little man o  war top and <eos>
<sos> unmentionables were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the <eos>
<sos> art of smoothing over life is tiny troubles and very quickly not one <eos>
<sos> speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit  still the blue <eos>
<sos> eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed <eos>
<sos> away the hurtness and shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and <eos>
<sos> said if she was near him she would not be far from him  her eyes dancing <eos>
<sos> in admonition  <eos>
<sos>  nasty bold jacky  she cried  <eos>
<sos> she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly  <eos>
<sos>  what is your name  butter and cream  <eos>
<sos>  tell us who is your sweetheart  spoke edy boardman  is cissy your <eos>
<sos> sweetheart  <eos>
<sos>  nao  tearful tommy said  <eos>
<sos>  is edy boardman your sweetheart  cissy queried  <eos>
<sos>  nao  tommy said  <eos>
<sos>  i know  edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from <eos>
<sos> her shortsighted eyes  i know who is tommy is sweetheart  gerty is <eos>
<sos> tommy is sweetheart  <eos>
<sos>  nao  tommy said on the verge of tears  <eos>
<sos> cissy is quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to edy <eos>
<sos> boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman <eos>
<sos> could not see and to mind he did not wet his new tan shoes  <eos>
<sos> but who was gerty  <eos>
<sos> gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions  lost in thought  <eos>
<sos> gazing far away into the distance was  in very truth  as fair a <eos>
<sos> specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see  she was <eos>
<sos> pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though  as folks often said  <eos>
<sos> she was more a giltrap than a macdowell  her figure was slight and <eos>
<sos> graceful  inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had <eos>
<sos> been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the <eos>
<sos> widow welch is female pills and she was much better of those discharges <eos>
<sos> she used to get and that tired feeling  the waxen pallor of her face <eos>
<sos> was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth <eos>
<sos> was a genuine cupid is bow  greekly perfect  her hands were of finely <eos>
<sos> veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and <eos>
<sos> queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used <eos>
<sos> to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either  bertha supple <eos>
<sos> told that once to edy boardman  a deliberate lie  when she was black <eos>
<sos> out at daggers drawn with gerty  the girl chums had of course their <eos>
<sos> little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals  and she told <eos>
<sos> her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or <eos>
<sos> she d never speak to her again  no  honour where honour is due  there <eos>
<sos> was an innate refinement  a languid queenly hauteur about gerty which <eos>
<sos> was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep  <eos>
<sos> had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in <eos>
<sos> her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education <eos>
<sos> gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the <eos>
<sos> land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow <eos>
<sos> and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their <eos>
<sos> devoirs to her  mayhap it was this  the love that might have been  that <eos>
<sos> lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look  tense with suppressed <eos>
<sos> meaning  that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful <eos>
<sos> eyes  a charm few could resist  why have women such eyes of witchery  <eos>
<sos> gerty is were of the bluest irish blue  set off by lustrous lashes and <eos>
<sos> dark expressive brows  time was when those brows were not so silkily <eos>
<sos> seductive  it was madame vera verity  directress of the woman beautiful <eos>
<sos> page of the princess novelette  who had first advised her to try <eos>
<sos> eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes  so <eos>
<sos> becoming in leaders of fashion  and she had never regretted it  then <eos>
<sos> there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase <eos>
<sos> your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose  that would <eos>
<sos> suit mrs dignam because she had a button one  but gerty is crowning <eos>
<sos> glory was her wealth of wonderful hair  it was dark brown with a <eos>
<sos> natural wave in it  she had cut it that very morning on account of the <eos>
<sos> new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of <eos>
<sos> luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too  thursday for wealth  and <eos>
<sos> just now at edy is words as a telltale flush  delicate as the faintest <eos>
<sos> rosebloom  crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet <eos>
<sos> girlish shyness that of a surety god is fair land of ireland did not <eos>
<sos> hold her equal  <eos>
<sos> for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes  she was <eos>
<sos> about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue  <eos>
<sos> inclination prompted her to speak out  dignity told her to be silent  <eos>
<sos> the pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out <eos>
<sos> into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young <eos>
<sos> may morning  she knew right well  no one better  what made squinty edy <eos>
<sos> say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a <eos>
<sos> lovers  quarrel  as per usual somebody is nose was out of joint about <eos>
<sos> the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding <eos>
<sos> up and down in front of her window  only now his father kept him in in <eos>
<sos> the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate <eos>
<sos> that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a <eos>
<sos> doctor when he left the high school like his brother w  e  wylie who <eos>
<sos> was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university  little <eos>
<sos> recked he perhaps for what she felt  that dull aching void in her heart <eos>
<sos> sometimes  piercing to the core  yet he was young and perchance he <eos>
<sos> might learn to love her in time  they were protestants in his family <eos>
<sos> and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed <eos>
<sos> virgin and then saint joseph  but he was undeniably handsome with an <eos>
<sos> exquisite nose and he was what he looked  every inch a gentleman  the <eos>
<sos> shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would <eos>
<sos> know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the <eos>
<sos> bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice <eos>
<sos> perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size <eos>
<sos> too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so <eos>
<sos> frightfully clever because he did not go and ride up and down in front <eos>
<sos> of her bit of a garden  <eos>
<sos> gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of <eos>
<sos> dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be <eos>
<sos> out  a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes  because <eos>
<sos> it was expected in the lady is pictorial that electric blue would be <eos>
<sos> worn  with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket <eos>
<sos>  in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her <eos>
<sos> favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit  and a navy <eos>
<sos> threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful <eos>
<sos> figure to perfection  she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of <eos>
<sos> wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue <eos>
<sos> chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone  all tuesday <eos>
<sos> week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she <eos>
<sos> found what she wanted at clery is summer sales  the very it  slightly <eos>
<sos> shopsoiled but you would never notice  seven fingers two and a penny  <eos>
<sos> she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on <eos>
<sos> then  smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to <eos>
<sos> her  and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew <eos>
<sos> that that would take the shine out of some people she knew  her shoes <eos>
<sos> were the newest thing in footwear  edy boardman prided herself that she <eos>
<sos> was very petite but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell  a <eos>
<sos> five  and never would ash  oak or elm  with patent toecaps and just one <eos>
<sos> smart buckle over her higharched instep  her wellturned ankle displayed <eos>
<sos> its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount <eos>
<sos> and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with <eos>
<sos> highspliced heels and wide garter tops  as for undies they were gerty is <eos>
<sos> chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet <eos>
<sos> seventeen  though gerty would never see seventeen again  can find it in <eos>
<sos> his heart to blame her  she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty <eos>
<sos> stitchery  three garments and nighties extra  and each set slotted with <eos>
<sos> different coloured ribbons  rosepink  pale blue  mauve and peagreen  <eos>
<sos> and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the <eos>
<sos> wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because <eos>
<sos> she would not trust those washerwomen as far as she d see them scorching <eos>
<sos> the things  she was wearing the blue for luck  hoping against hope  her <eos>
<sos> own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on <eos>
<sos> her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his <eos>
<sos> father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and <eos>
<sos> because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was <eos>
<sos> dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside <eos>
<sos> out and that was for luck and lovers  meeting if you put those things <eos>
<sos> on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so <eos>
<sos> long as it was not of a friday  <eos>
<sos> and yet and yet  that strained look on her face  a gnawing sorrow is <eos>
<sos> there all the time  her very soul is in her eyes and she would give <eos>
<sos> worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where  giving <eos>
<sos> way to tears  she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings <eos>
<sos> though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the <eos>
<sos> mirror  you are lovely  gerty  it said  the paly light of evening falls <eos>
<sos> upon a face infinitely sad and wistful  gerty macdowell yearns in vain  <eos>
<sos> yes  she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage <eos>
<sos> has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie t  <eos>
<sos> c  d   because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs <eos>
<sos> wylie  and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was <eos>
<sos> wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox <eos>
<sos> was not to be  he was too young to understand  he would not believe in <eos>
<sos> love  a woman is birthright  the night of the party long ago in stoer is <eos>
<sos>  he was still in short trousers  when they were alone and he stole an <eos>
<sos> arm round her waist she went white to the very lips  he called her <eos>
<sos> little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss  the <eos>
<sos> first   but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from <eos>
<sos> the room with a remark about refreshments  impetuous fellow  strength <eos>
<sos> of character had never been reggy wylie is strong point and he who would <eos>
<sos> woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men  but waiting  <eos>
<sos> always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be <eos>
<sos> over  no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous <eos>
<sos> love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who <eos>
<sos> had not found his ideal  perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey  <eos>
<sos> and who would understand  take her in his sheltering arms  strain her <eos>
<sos> to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort <eos>
<sos> her with a long long kiss  it would be like heaven  for such a one she <eos>
<sos> yearns this balmy summer eve  with all the heart of her she longs to be <eos>
<sos> his only  his affianced bride for riches for poor  in sickness in <eos>
<sos> health  till death us two part  from this to this day forward  <eos>
<sos> and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was <eos>
<sos> just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his <eos>
<sos> little wife to be  then they could talk about her till they went blue <eos>
<sos> in the face  bertha supple too  and edy  little spitfire  because she <eos>
<sos> would be twentytwo in november  she would care for him with creature <eos>
<sos> comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked <eos>
<sos> that feeling of hominess  her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue <eos>
<sos> and queen ann is pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden <eos>
<sos> opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a <eos>
<sos> fire  dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same <eos>
<sos> direction  then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of <eos>
<sos> eggs though she did not like the eating part when there were any people <eos>
<sos> that made her shy and often she wondered why you could not eat something <eos>
<sos> poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully <eos>
<sos> appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph <eos>
<sos> of grandpapa giltrap is lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was <eos>
<sos> so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in <eos>
<sos> clery is summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses  he would be <eos>
<sos> tall with broad shoulders  she had always admired tall men for a <eos>
<sos> husband  with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed <eos>
<sos> sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their <eos>
<sos> honeymoon  three wonderful weeks   and then  when they settled down in <eos>
<sos> a nice snug and cosy little homely house  every morning they would both <eos>
<sos> have brekky  simple but perfectly served  for their own two selves and <eos>
<sos> before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a <eos>
<sos> good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes  <eos>
<sos> edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then <eos>
<sos> she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run <eos>
<sos> off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight  but tommy <eos>
<sos> said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with <eos>
<sos> the ball and if he took it there d be wigs on the green but tommy said <eos>
<sos> it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground  if <eos>
<sos> you please  the temper of him  o  he was a man already was little tommy <eos>
<sos> caffrey since he was out of pinnies  edy told him no  no and to be off <eos>
<sos> now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him  <eos>
<sos>  you re not my sister  naughty tommy said  it is my ball  <eos>
<sos> but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up  look up high at her <eos>
<sos> finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand <eos>
<sos> and tommy after it in full career  having won the day  <eos>
<sos>  anything for a quiet life  laughed ciss  <eos>
<sos> and she tickled tiny tot is two cheeks to make him forget and played <eos>
<sos> here is the lord mayor  here is his two horses  here is his gingerbread <eos>
<sos> carriage and here he walks in  chinchopper  chinchopper  chinchopper <eos>
<sos> chin  but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way <eos>
<sos> like that from everyone always petting him  <eos>
<sos>  i d like to give him something  she said  so i would  where i wo not <eos>
<sos> say  <eos>
<sos>  on the beeoteetom  laughed cissy merrily  <eos>
<sos> gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy <eos>
<sos> saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she d be ashamed of her <eos>
<sos> life to say  flushing a deep rosy red  and edy boardman said she was <eos>
<sos> sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said  but not a pin cared <eos>
<sos> ciss  <eos>
<sos>  let him  she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of <eos>
<sos> her nose  give it to him too on the same place as quick as i d look at <eos>
<sos> him  <eos>
<sos> madcap ciss with her golliwog curls  you had to laugh at her sometimes  <eos>
<sos> for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea <eos>
<sos> and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men is faces on <eos>
<sos> her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to <eos>
<sos> go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the <eos>
<sos> miss white  that was just like cissycums  o  and will you ever forget <eos>
<sos> her the evening she dressed up in her father is suit and hat and the <eos>
<sos> burned cork moustache and walked down tritonville road  smoking a <eos>
<sos> cigarette  there was none to come up to her for fun  but she was <eos>
<sos> sincerity itself  one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever <eos>
<sos> made  not one of your twofaced things  too sweet to be wholesome  <eos>
<sos> and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the <eos>
<sos> pealing anthem of the organ  it was the men is temperance retreat <eos>
<sos> conducted by the missioner  the reverend john hughes s  j   rosary  <eos>
<sos> sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament  they were there <eos>
<sos> gathered together without distinction of social class  and a most <eos>
<sos> edifying spectacle it was to see  in that simple fane beside the waves  <eos>
<sos> after the storms of this weary world  kneeling before the feet of the <eos>
<sos> immaculate  reciting the litany of our lady of loreto  beseeching her <eos>
<sos> to intercede for them  the old familiar words  holy mary  holy virgin <eos>
<sos> of virgins  how sad to poor gerty is ears  had her father only avoided <eos>
<sos> the clutches of the demon drink  by taking the pledge or those powders <eos>
<sos> the drink habit cured in pearson is weekly  she might now be rolling in <eos>
<sos> her carriage  second to none  over and over had she told herself that <eos>
<sos> as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp <eos>
<sos> because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window <eos>
<sos> dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket  thinking  <eos>
<sos> but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had <eos>
<sos> cast its shadow over her childhood days  nay  she had even witnessed in <eos>
<sos> the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen <eos>
<sos> her own father  a prey to the fumes of intoxication  forget himself <eos>
<sos> completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it <eos>
<sos> was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of <eos>
<sos> kindness  deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low  <eos>
<sos> and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful  <eos>
<sos> virgin most merciful  and gerty  rapt in thought  scarce saw or heard <eos>
<sos> her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman <eos>
<sos> off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like <eos>
<sos> himself passing along the strand taking a short walk  you never saw him <eos>
<sos> any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a <eos>
<sos> father because he was too old or something or on account of his face <eos>
<sos>  it was a palpable case of doctor fell  or his carbuncly nose with the <eos>
<sos> pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose  poor <eos>
<sos> father  with all his faults she loved him still when he sang _tell me  <eos>
<sos> mary  how to woo thee or my love and cottage near rochelle_ and they <eos>
<sos> had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenby is salad dressing for supper <eos>
<sos> and when he sang the moon hath raised with mr dignam that died <eos>
<sos> suddenly and was buried  god have mercy on him  from a stroke  her <eos>
<sos> mother is birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom <eos>
<sos> and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have <eos>
<sos> had a group taken  no one would have thought the end was so near  now <eos>
<sos> he was laid to rest  and her mother said to him to let that be a <eos>
<sos> warning to him for the rest of his days and he could not even go to the <eos>
<sos> funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him <eos>
<sos> the letters and samples from his office about catesby is cork lino  <eos>
<sos> artistic  standard designs  fit for a palace  gives tiptop wear and <eos>
<sos> always bright and cheery in the home  <eos>
<sos> a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the <eos>
<sos> house  a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in <eos>
<sos> gold  and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was <eos>
<sos> it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she did not <eos>
<sos> like her mother is taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single <eos>
<sos> thing they ever had words about  taking snuff  everyone thought the <eos>
<sos> world of her for her gentle ways  it was gerty who turned off the gas <eos>
<sos> at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of <eos>
<sos> that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime <eos>
<sos> mr tunney the grocer is christmas almanac  the picture of halcyon days <eos>
<sos> where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a <eos>
<sos> threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with <eos>
<sos> oldtime chivalry through her lattice window  you could see there was a <eos>
<sos> story behind it  the colours were done something lovely  she was in a <eos>
<sos> soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in <eos>
<sos> chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat  she often looked at them <eos>
<sos> dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own <eos>
<sos> arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and <eos>
<sos> thought about those times because she had found out in walker is <eos>
<sos> pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the <eos>
<sos> halcyon days what they meant  <eos>
<sos> the twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till <eos>
<sos> at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no <eos>
<sos> getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he <eos>
<sos> could down towards the seaweedy rocks  needless to say poor tommy was <eos>
<sos> not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was <eos>
<sos> sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted <eos>
<sos> the ball  our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries <eos>
<sos> and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it <eos>
<sos> to her please  the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then <eos>
<sos> threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the <eos>
<sos> slope and stopped right under gerty is skirt near the little pool by the <eos>
<sos> rock  the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it <eos>
<sos> away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she <eos>
<sos> wished their stupid ball had not come rolling down to her and she gave a <eos>
<sos> kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed  <eos>
<sos>  if you fail try again  edy boardman said  <eos>
<sos> gerty smiled assent and bit her lip  a delicate pink crept into her <eos>
<sos> pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted <eos>
<sos> her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball <eos>
<sos> a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it <eos>
<sos> down towards the shingle  pure jealousy of course it was nothing else <eos>
<sos> to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking  she <eos>
<sos> felt the warm flush  a danger signal always with gerty macdowell  <eos>
<sos> surging and flaming into her cheeks  till then they had only exchanged <eos>
<sos> glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she <eos>
<sos> ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the <eos>
<sos> twilight  wan and strangely drawn  seemed to her the saddest she had <eos>
<sos> ever seen  <eos>
<sos> through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted <eos>
<sos> and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain <eos>
<sos> of original sin  spiritual vessel  pray for us  honourable vessel  pray <eos>
<sos> for us  vessel of singular devotion  pray for us  mystical rose  and <eos>
<sos> careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many <eos>
<sos> who had erred and wandered  their eyes wet with contrition but for all <eos>
<sos> that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told <eos>
<sos> them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary  <eos>
<sos> the most pious virgin is intercessory power that it was not recorded in <eos>
<sos> any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever <eos>
<sos> abandoned by her  <eos>
<sos> the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of <eos>
<sos> childhood are but as fleeting summer showers  cissy caffrey played with <eos>
<sos> baby boardman till he crowed with glee  clapping baby hands in air  <eos>
<sos> peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was <eos>
<sos> cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah  and  my <eos>
<sos> word  did not the little chap enjoy that  and then she told him to say <eos>
<sos> papa  <eos>
<sos>  say papa  baby  say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa  <eos>
<sos> and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for <eos>
<sos> eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of <eos>
<sos> health  a perfect little bunch of love  and he would certainly turn out <eos>
<sos> to be something great  they said  <eos>
<sos>  haja ja ja haja  <eos>
<sos> cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to <eos>
<sos> sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried <eos>
<sos> out  holy saint denis  that he was possing wet and to double the half <eos>
<sos> blanket the other way under him  of course his infant majesty was most <eos>
<sos> obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it  <eos>
<sos>  habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa  <eos>
<sos> and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks  it was all <eos>
<sos> no use soothering him with no  nono  baby  no and telling him about the <eos>
<sos> geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss  always readywitted  gave <eos>
<sos> him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen <eos>
<sos> was quickly appeased  <eos>
<sos> gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out <eos>
<sos> of that and not get on her nerves  no hour to be out  and the little <eos>
<sos> brats of twins  she gazed out towards the distant sea  it was like the <eos>
<sos> paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured <eos>
<sos> chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out  <eos>
<sos> the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and <eos>
<sos> to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they <eos>
<sos> burned in the church like a kind of waft  and while she gazed her heart <eos>
<sos> went pitapat  yes  it was her he was looking at  and there was meaning <eos>
<sos> in his look  his eyes burned into her as though they would search her <eos>
<sos> through and through  read her very soul  wonderful eyes they were  <eos>
<sos> superbly expressive  but could you trust them  people were so queer  <eos>
<sos> she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face <eos>
<sos> that he was a foreigner  the image of the photo she had of martin <eos>
<sos> harvey  the matinee idol  only for the moustache which she preferred <eos>
<sos> because she was not stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they <eos>
<sos> two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see <eos>
<sos> whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retroussé from where he <eos>
<sos> was sitting  he was in deep mourning  she could see that  and the story <eos>
<sos> of a haunting sorrow was written on his face  she would have given <eos>
<sos> worlds to know what it was  he was looking up so intently  so still  <eos>
<sos> and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel <eos>
<sos> buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the <eos>
<sos> toes down  she was glad that something told her to put on the <eos>
<sos> transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was <eos>
<sos> far away  here was that of which she had so often dreamed  it was he <eos>
<sos> who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him <eos>
<sos> because she felt instinctively that he was like no one else  the very <eos>
<sos> heart of the girlwoman went out to him  her dreamhusband  because she <eos>
<sos> knew on the instant it was him  if he had suffered  more sinned against <eos>
<sos> than sinning  or even  even  if he had been himself a sinner  a wicked <eos>
<sos> man  she cared not  even if he was a protestant or methodist she could <eos>
<sos> convert him easily if he truly loved her  there were wounds that wanted <eos>
<sos> healing with heartbalm  she was a womanly woman not like other flighty <eos>
<sos> girls unfeminine he had known  those cyclists showing off what they <eos>
<sos> had not got and she just yearned to know all  to forgive all if she <eos>
<sos> could make him fall in love with her  make him forget the memory of the <eos>
<sos> past  then mayhap he would embrace her gently  like a real man  <eos>
<sos> crushing her soft body to him  and love her  his ownest girlie  for <eos>
<sos> herself alone  <eos>
<sos> refuge of sinners  comfortress of the afflicted  ora pro nobis  well <eos>
<sos> has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy <eos>
<sos> can never be lost or cast away  and fitly is she too a haven of refuge <eos>
<sos> for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her <eos>
<sos> own heart  gerty could picture the whole scene in the church  the <eos>
<sos> stained glass windows lighted up  the candles  the flowers and the blue <eos>
<sos> banners of the blessed virgin is sodality and father conroy was helping <eos>
<sos> canon o hanlon at the altar  carrying things in and out with his eyes <eos>
<sos> cast down  he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet <eos>
<sos> and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever <eos>
<sos> she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come <eos>
<sos> to the convent for the novena of saint dominic  he told her that time <eos>
<sos> when she told him about that in confession  crimsoning up to the roots <eos>
<sos> of her hair for fear he could see  not to be troubled because that was <eos>
<sos> only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature is laws  he <eos>
<sos> said  in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the <eos>
<sos> nature of woman instituted by god  he said  and that our blessed lady <eos>
<sos> herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to <eos>
<sos> thy word  he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and <eos>
<sos> thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design <eos>
<sos> for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the <eos>
<sos> mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little <eos>
<sos> house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the <eos>
<sos> forty hours  adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a <eos>
<sos> present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or <eos>
<sos> some place  <eos>
<sos> the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky <eos>
<sos> threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it  little <eos>
<sos> monkeys common as ditchwater  someone ought to take them and give them <eos>
<sos> a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places  the both of <eos>
<sos> them  and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they <eos>
<sos> were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned  <eos>
<sos>  jacky  tommy  <eos>
<sos> not they  what a great notion they had  so cissy said it was the very <eos>
<sos> last time she d ever bring them out  she jumped up and called them and <eos>
<sos> she ran down the slope past him  tossing her hair behind her which had <eos>
<sos> a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the <eos>
<sos> thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she could not get it to grow <eos>
<sos> long because it was not natural so she could just go and throw her hat <eos>
<sos> at it  she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she did not rip <eos>
<sos> up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a <eos>
<sos> lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece <eos>
<sos> whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just <eos>
<sos> because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see <eos>
<sos> all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as <eos>
<sos> possible  it would have served her just right if she had tripped up <eos>
<sos> over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french <eos>
<sos> heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble  tableau  <eos>
<sos> that would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that <eos>
<sos> to witness  <eos>
<sos> queen of angels  queen of patriarchs  queen of prophets  of all saints  <eos>
<sos> they prayed  queen of the most holy rosary and then father conroy <eos>
<sos> handed the thurible to canon o hanlon and he put in the incense and <eos>
<sos> censed the blessed sacrament and cissy caffrey caught the two twins and <eos>
<sos> she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she <eos>
<sos> did not because she thought he might be watching but she never made a <eos>
<sos> bigger mistake in all her life because gerty could see without looking <eos>
<sos> that he never took his eyes off of her and then canon o hanlon handed <eos>
<sos> the thurible back to father conroy and knelt down looking up at the <eos>
<sos> blessed sacrament and the choir began to sing the tantum ergo and she <eos>
<sos> just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to <eos>
<sos> the tantumer gosa cramen tum  three and eleven she paid for those <eos>
<sos> stockings in sparrow is of george is street on the tuesday  no the monday <eos>
<sos> before easter and there was not a brack on them and that was what he was <eos>
<sos> looking at  transparent  and not at her insignificant ones that had <eos>
<sos> neither shape nor form  the cheek of her   because he had eyes in his <eos>
<sos> head to see the difference for himself  <eos>
<sos> cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with <eos>
<sos> her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a <eos>
<sos> streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought <eos>
<sos> only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her <eos>
<sos> petticoat hanging like a caricature  gerty just took off her hat for a <eos>
<sos> moment to settle her hair and a prettier  a daintier head of nutbrown <eos>
<sos> tresses was never seen on a girl is shoulders a radiant little vision  <eos>
<sos> in sooth  almost maddening in its sweetness  you would have to travel <eos>
<sos> many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that  she <eos>
<sos> could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes <eos>
<sos> that set her tingling in every nerve  she put on her hat so that she <eos>
<sos> could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster <eos>
<sos> for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes  he was <eos>
<sos> eying her as a snake eyes its prey  her woman is instinct told her that <eos>
<sos> she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet <eos>
<sos> swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a <eos>
<sos> glorious rose  <eos>
<sos> edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty  <eos>
<sos> half smiling  with her specs like an old maid  pretending to nurse the <eos>
<sos> baby  irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was <eos>
<sos> why no one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no <eos>
<sos> concern of hers  and she said to gerty  <eos>
<sos>  a penny for your thoughts  <eos>
<sos>  what  replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth  i <eos>
<sos> was only wondering was it late  <eos>
<sos> because she wished to goodness they d take the snottynosed twins and <eos>
<sos> their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just <eos>
<sos> gave a gentle hint about its being late  and when cissy came up edy <eos>
<sos> asked her the time and miss cissy  as glib as you like  said it was <eos>
<sos> half past kissing time  time to kiss again  but edy wanted to know <eos>
<sos> because they were told to be in early  <eos>
<sos>  wait  said cissy  i ll run ask my uncle peter over there what is the <eos>
<sos> time by his conundrum  <eos>
<sos> so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his <eos>
<sos> hand out of his pocket  getting nervous  and beginning to play with his <eos>
<sos> watchchain  looking up at the church  passionate nature though he was <eos>
<sos> gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself  one moment <eos>
<sos> he had been there  fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze  and <eos>
<sos> the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman  selfcontrol <eos>
<sos> expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure  <eos>
<sos> cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the <eos>
<sos> right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch  listening to <eos>
<sos> it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry <eos>
<sos> his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the <eos>
<sos> sun was set  his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in <eos>
<sos> measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones  <eos>
<sos> cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said <eos>
<sos> his waterworks were out of order  <eos>
<sos> then they sang the second verse of the tantum ergo and canon o hanlon <eos>
<sos> got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he <eos>
<sos> told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire <eos>
<sos> to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and <eos>
<sos> she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the <eos>
<sos> works and she swung her leg more in and out in time  it was getting <eos>
<sos> darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was <eos>
<sos> winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it <eos>
<sos> back and put his hands back into his pockets  she felt a kind of a <eos>
<sos> sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp <eos>
<sos> and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on <eos>
<sos> because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of <eos>
<sos> the moon  his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her <eos>
<sos> every contour  literally worshipping at her shrine  if ever there was <eos>
<sos> undisguised admiration in a man is passionate gaze it was there plain to <eos>
<sos> be seen on that man is face  it is for you  gertrude macdowell  and you <eos>
<sos> know it  <eos>
<sos> edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty <eos>
<sos> noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect <eos>
<sos> because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place <eos>
<sos> to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins  caps and tidied <eos>
<sos> their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon o hanlon <eos>
<sos> stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed <eos>
<sos> him the card to read off and he read out _panem de coelo praestitisti <eos>
<sos> eis_ and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and <eos>
<sos> asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just <eos>
<sos> answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she <eos>
<sos> heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over  gerty winced sharply  <eos>
<sos> a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn <eos>
<sos> immeasurable  it hurt o yes  it cut deep because edy had her own quiet <eos>
<sos> way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded <eos>
<sos> little cat she was  gerty is lips parted swiftly to frame the word but <eos>
<sos> she fought back the sob that rose to her throat  so slim  so flawless  <eos>
<sos> so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of  <eos>
<sos> she had loved him better than he knew  lighthearted deceiver and fickle <eos>
<sos> like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and <eos>
<sos> for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears  <eos>
<sos> their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she <eos>
<sos> sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them <eos>
<sos> to see  <eos>
<sos>  o  responded gerty  quick as lightning  laughing  and the proud head <eos>
<sos> flashed up  i can throw my cap at who i like because it is leap year  <eos>
<sos> her words rang out crystalclear  more musical than the cooing of the <eos>
<sos> ringdove  but they cut the silence icily  there was that in her young <eos>
<sos> voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with  as <eos>
<sos> for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck <eos>
<sos> him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as <eos>
<sos> much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a <eos>
<sos> dozen pieces  and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him <eos>
<sos> one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot  <eos>
<sos> miss puny little edy is countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty <eos>
<sos> could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a <eos>
<sos> towering rage though she hid it  the little kinnatt  because that shaft <eos>
<sos> had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was <eos>
<sos> something aloof  apart  in another sphere  that she was not of them and <eos>
<sos> never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it <eos>
<sos> so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it  <eos>
<sos> edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked <eos>
<sos> in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because <eos>
<sos> the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior  and cissy told <eos>
<sos> him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and <eos>
<sos> baby looked just too ducky  laughing up out of his gleeful eyes  and <eos>
<sos> cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby  <eos>
<sos> without as much as by your leave  sent up his compliments to all and <eos>
<sos> sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib  <eos>
<sos>  o my  puddeny pie  protested ciss  he has his bib destroyed  <eos>
<sos> the slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set <eos>
<sos> that little matter to rights  <eos>
<sos> gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy <eos>
<sos> asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was <eos>
<sos> flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed <eos>
<sos> it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction <eos>
<sos> because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet <eos>
<sos> seashore because canon o hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that <eos>
<sos> father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the <eos>
<sos> blessed sacrament in his hands  <eos>
<sos> how moving the scene there in the gathering twilight  the last glimpse <eos>
<sos> of erin  the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time <eos>
<sos> a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk  hither  <eos>
<sos> thither  with a tiny lost cry  and she could see far away the lights of <eos>
<sos> the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of <eos>
<sos> paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the <eos>
<sos> lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church <eos>
<sos> grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked <eos>
<sos> and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn <eos>
<sos> his freewheel like she read in that book the lamplighter by miss <eos>
<sos> cummins  author of mabel vaughan and other tales  for gerty had her <eos>
<sos> dreams that no one knew of  she loved to read poetry and when she got a <eos>
<sos> keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the <eos>
<sos> coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of <eos>
<sos> her toilettable which  though it did not err on the side of luxury  was <eos>
<sos> scrupulously neat and clean  it was there she kept her girlish treasure <eos>
<sos> trove  the tortoiseshell combs  her child of mary badge  the whiterose <eos>
<sos> scent  the eyebrowleine  her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to <eos>
<sos> change when her things came home from the wash and there were some <eos>
<sos> beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in <eos>
<sos> hely is of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if <eos>
<sos> she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so <eos>
<sos> deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening <eos>
<sos> round the potherbs  art thou real  my ideal  it was called by louis j <eos>
<sos> walsh  magherafelt  and after there was something about _twilight  wilt <eos>
<sos> thou ever _ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry  so sad in its transient <eos>
<sos> loveliness  had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the <eos>
<sos> years were slipping by for her  one by one  and but for that one <eos>
<sos> shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an <eos>
<sos> accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it  <eos>
<sos> but it must end  she felt  if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there <eos>
<sos> would be no holding back for her  love laughs at locksmiths  she would <eos>
<sos> make the great sacrifice  her every effort would be to share his <eos>
<sos> thoughts  dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his <eos>
<sos> days with happiness  there was the allimportant question and she was <eos>
<sos> dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife <eos>
<sos> or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land <eos>
<sos> of song had to have her put into a madhouse  cruel only to be kind  but <eos>
<sos> even if what then  would it make a very great difference  from <eos>
<sos> everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively <eos>
<sos> recoiled  she loathed that sort of person  the fallen women off the <eos>
<sos> accommodation walk beside the dodder that went with the soldiers and <eos>
<sos> coarse men with no respect for a girl is honour  degrading the sex and <eos>
<sos> being taken up to the police station  no  no  not that  they would be <eos>
<sos> just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other <eos>
<sos> in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess  perhaps it was <eos>
<sos> an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall  she <eos>
<sos> thought she understood  she would try to understand him because men <eos>
<sos> were so different  the old love was waiting  waiting with little white <eos>
<sos> hands stretched out  with blue appealing eyes  heart of mine  she would <eos>
<sos> follow  her dream of love  the dictates of her heart that told her he <eos>
<sos> was her all in all  the only man in all the world for her for love was <eos>
<sos> the master guide  nothing else mattered  come what might she would be <eos>
<sos> wild  untrammelled  free  <eos>
<sos> canon o hanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and <eos>
<sos> genuflected and the choir sang laudate dominum omnes gentes and then <eos>
<sos> he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and <eos>
<sos> father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked <eos>
<sos> was not she coming but jacky caffrey called out  <eos>
<sos>  o  look  cissy  <eos>
<sos> and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over <eos>
<sos> the trees beside the church  blue and then green and purple  <eos>
<sos>  it is fireworks  cissy caffrey said  <eos>
<sos> and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church  <eos>
<sos> helterskelter  edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy <eos>
<sos> holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they would not fall running  <eos>
<sos>  come on  gerty  cissy called  it is the bazaar fireworks  <eos>
<sos> but gerty was adamant  she had no intention of being at their beck and <eos>
<sos> call  if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she <eos>
<sos> could see from where she was  the eyes that were fastened upon her set <eos>
<sos> her pulses tingling  she looked at him a moment  meeting his glance  <eos>
<sos> and a light broke in upon her  whitehot passion was in that face  <eos>
<sos> passion silent as the grave  and it had made her his  at last they were <eos>
<sos> left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he <eos>
<sos> could be trusted to the death  steadfast  a sterling man  a man of <eos>
<sos> inflexible honour to his fingertips  his hands and face were working <eos>
<sos> and a tremour went over her  she leaned back far to look up where the <eos>
<sos> fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall <eos>
<sos> back looking up and there was no one to see only him and her when she <eos>
<sos> revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that  supply <eos>
<sos> soft and delicately rounded  and she seemed to hear the panting of his <eos>
<sos> heart  his hoarse breathing  because she knew too about the passion of <eos>
<sos> men like that  hotblooded  because bertha supple told her once in dead <eos>
<sos> secret and made her swear she d never about the gentleman lodger that <eos>
<sos> was staying with them out of the congested districts board that had <eos>
<sos> pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and <eos>
<sos> she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine <eos>
<sos> sometimes in the bed  but this was altogether different from a thing <eos>
<sos> like that because there was all the difference because she could almost <eos>
<sos> feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his <eos>
<sos> handsome lips  besides there was absolution so long as you did not do <eos>
<sos> the other thing before being married and there ought to be women <eos>
<sos> priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy <eos>
<sos> caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes <eos>
<sos> so that she too  my dear  and winny rippingham so mad about actors  <eos>
<sos> photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on <eos>
<sos> the way it did  <eos>
<sos> and jacky caffrey shouted to look  there was another and she leaned <eos>
<sos> back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent <eos>
<sos> and they all saw it and they all shouted to look  look  there it was <eos>
<sos> and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something <eos>
<sos> queer was flying through the air  a soft thing  to and fro  dark  and <eos>
<sos> she saw a long roman candle going up over the trees  up  up  and  in <eos>
<sos> the tense hush  they were all breathless with excitement as it went <eos>
<sos> higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up <eos>
<sos> after it  high  high  almost out of sight  and her face was suffused <eos>
<sos> with a divine  an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see <eos>
<sos> her other things too  nainsook knickers  the fabric that caresses the <eos>
<sos> skin  better than those other pettiwidth  the green  four and eleven  <eos>
<sos> on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and <eos>
<sos> then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was <eos>
<sos> trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full <eos>
<sos> view high up above her knee where no one ever not even on the swing or <eos>
<sos> wading and she was not ashamed and he was not either to look in that <eos>
<sos> immodest way like that because he could not resist the sight of the <eos>
<sos> wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so <eos>
<sos> immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking  looking  she <eos>
<sos> would fain have cried to him chokingly  held out her snowy slender arms <eos>
<sos> to him to come  to feel his lips laid on her white brow  the cry of a <eos>
<sos> young girl is love  a little strangled cry  wrung from her  that cry <eos>
<sos> that has rung through the ages  and then a rocket sprang and bang shot <eos>
<sos> blind blank and o  then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh <eos>
<sos> of o  and everyone cried o  o  in raptures and it gushed out of it a <eos>
<sos> stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah  they were all <eos>
<sos> greeny dewy stars falling with golden  o so lovely  o  soft  sweet  <eos>
<sos> soft  <eos>
<sos> then all melted away dewily in the grey air  all was silent  ah  she <eos>
<sos> glanced at him as she bent forward quickly  a pathetic little glance of <eos>
<sos> piteous protest  of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl  <eos>
<sos> he was leaning back against the rock behind  leopold bloom  for it is <eos>
<sos> he  stands silent  with bowed head before those young guileless eyes  <eos>
<sos> what a brute he had been  at it again  a fair unsullied soul had called <eos>
<sos> to him and  wretch that he was  how had he answered  an utter cad he <eos>
<sos> had been  he of all men  but there was an infinite store of mercy in <eos>
<sos> those eyes  for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and <eos>
<sos> sinned and wandered  should a girl tell  no  a thousand times no  that <eos>
<sos> was their secret  only theirs  alone in the hiding twilight and there <eos>

<sos> heart  full of a strange shining  hung enraptured on her sweet <eos>
<sos> flowerlike face  she half smiled at him wanly  a sweet forgiving smile  <eos>
<sos> a smile that verged on tears  and then they parted  <eos>
<sos> slowly  without looking back she went down the uneven strand to cissy  <eos>
<sos> to edy to jacky and tommy caffrey  to little baby boardman  it was <eos>
<sos> darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and <eos>

<sos> worse fool of myself however  instead of talking about nothing  then i <eos>
<sos> will tell you all  still it was a kind of language between us  it <eos>
<sos> could not be  no  gerty they called her  might be false name however <eos>
<sos> like my name and the address dolphin is barn a blind  <eos>
<sos> her maiden name was jemina brown <eos>

<sos> place made me think of that i suppose  all tarred with the same brush  <eos>
<sos> wiping pens in their stockings  but the ball rolled down to her as if <eos>
<sos> it understood  every bullet has its billet  course i never could throw <eos>
<sos> anything straight at school  crooked as a ram is horn  sad however <eos>

<sos> husband  chickens come home to roost  they stick by one another like <eos>
<sos> glue  maybe the women is fault also  that is where molly can knock spots <eos>
<sos> off them  it is the blood of the south  moorish  also the form  the <eos>
<sos> figure  hands felt for the opulent  just compare for instance those <eos>
<sos> others  wife locked up at home  skeleton in the cupboard  allow me to <eos>

<sos> wife  still there is destiny in it  falling in love  have their own <eos>
<sos> secrets between them  chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman <eos>

<sos> pill lane  also that now is magnetism  back of everything magnetism  <eos>
<sos> earth for instance pulling this and being pulled  that causes movement  <eos>
<sos> and time  well that is the time the movement takes  then if one thing <eos>
<sos> stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit  because it is all <eos>
<sos> arranged  magnetic needle tells you what is going on in the sun  the <eos>
<sos> stars  little piece of steel iron  when you hold out the fork  come  <eos>

<sos> which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in <eos>
<sos> them high mind is ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain <eos>
<sos> when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being <eos>
<sos> equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more <eos>
<sos> efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have <eos>
<sos> progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent <eos>
<sos> continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when <eos>
<sos> fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent <eos>
<sos> nature is incorrupted benefaction  for who is there who anything of some <eos>
<sos> significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior <eos>
<sos> splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or <eos>
<sos> on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive <eos>
<sos> that as no nature is boon can contend against the bounty of increase so <eos>
<sos> it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and <eos>
<sos> admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past <eos>
<sos> been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not <eos>
<sos> with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have <eos>
<sos> gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to <eos>
<sos> that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who <eos>
<sos> would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence <eos>
<sos> can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel <eos>
<sos> simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy <eos>
<sos> of abundance or with diminution is menace that exalted of reiteratedly <eos>
<sos> procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined  <eos>
<sos> it is not why therefore we shall wonder if  as the best historians <eos>
<sos> relate  among the celts  who nothing that was not in its nature <eos>
<sos> admirable admired  the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured  <eos>
<sos> not to speak of hostels  leperyards  sweating chambers  plaguegraves  <eos>

<sos> withering or loose boyconnell flux  certainly in every public work <eos>
<sos> which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with <eos>
<sos> importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted <eos>
<sos>  whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it <eos>
<sos> is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent <eos>
<sos> inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest  <eos>
<sos> whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that <eos>
<sos> whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly <eos>
<sos> required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who <eos>
<sos> not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely <eos>

<sos> naked forth from his mother is womb so naked shall he wend him at the <eos>
<sos> last for to go as he came  <eos>
<sos> the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman <eos>
<sos> and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in <eos>
<sos> childbed  the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in <eos>
<sos> throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to <eos>
<sos> bear but that now in a little it would be  she said thereto that she <eos>
<sos> had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that <eos>
<sos> woman is birth  then she set it all forth to him for because she knew <eos>
<sos> the man that time was had lived nigh that house  the man hearkened to <eos>
<sos> her words for he felt with wonder women is woe in the travail that they <eos>
<sos> have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair <eos>
<sos> face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a <eos>
<sos> handmaid  nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless  <eos>
<sos> and whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there <eos>
<sos> nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat  and there <eos>
<sos> came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept <eos>
<sos> dixon  and the traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed <eos>
<sos> that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where <eos>
<sos> this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be <eos>
<sos> healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a <eos>
<sos> horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a <eos>
<sos> salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice  and he <eos>
<sos> said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with <eos>
<sos> them that were there  and the traveller leopold said that he should go <eos>
<sos> otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile  also the lady <eos>
<sos> was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well <eos>
<sos> that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility  but <eos>
<sos> the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have <eos>
<sos> him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a <eos>
<sos> marvellous castle  and the traveller leopold went into the castle for <eos>
<sos> to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches <eos>
<sos> environing in divers lands and sometime venery  <eos>
<sos> and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy <eos>
<sos> and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not <eos>
<sos> move more for enchantment  and on this board were frightful swords and <eos>
<sos> knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white <eos>
<sos> flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there <eos>
<sos> abound marvellously  and there were vessels that are wrought by magic <eos>
<sos> of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that <eos>
<sos> he blases in to them like to bubbles  and full fair cheer and rich was <eos>
<sos> on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer  and there <eos>
<sos> was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay <eos>
<sos> strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be <eos>
<sos> possible thing without they see it natheless they are so  and these <eos>
<sos> fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of <eos>
<sos> the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress  and <eos>
<sos> also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a <eos>
<sos> compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of <eos>
<sos> certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like <eos>
<sos> to a vast mountain  and they teach the serpents there to entwine <eos>
<sos> themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of <eos>
<sos> these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead  <eos>
<sos> and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp <eos>
<sos> thereto the while all they that were there drank every each  and childe <eos>
<sos> leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat <eos>
<sos> in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and <eos>
<sos> anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and <eos>
<sos> his neighbour nist not of this wile  and he sat down in that castle <eos>
<sos> with them for to rest him there awhile  thanked be almighty god  <eos>
<sos> this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at <eos>
<sos> the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing <eos>
<sos> for there was above one quick with child  a gentle dame  whose time <eos>
<sos> hied fast  sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered <eos>
<sos> what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel  said he  <eos>
<sos> that it be not come or now  meseems it dureth overlong  and he was ware <eos>
<sos> and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was <eos>
<sos> older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights <eos>
<sos> virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke <eos>
<sos> to him full gently  but  said he  or it be long too she will bring <eos>
<sos> forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath <eos>
<sos> waited marvellous long  and the franklin that had drunken said  <eos>
<sos> expecting each moment to be her next  also he took the cup that stood <eos>
<sos> tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to <eos>
<sos> drink and  now drink  said he  fully delectably  and he quaffed as far <eos>
<sos> as he might to their both is health for he was a passing good man of his <eos>
<sos> lustiness  and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat <eos>
<sos> in scholars  hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that <eos>
<sos> ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight <eos>
<sos> of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged <eos>
<sos> him courtly in the cup  woman is woe with wonder pondering  <eos>
<sos> now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be <eos>
<sos> drunken an they might  there was a sort of scholars along either side <eos>
<sos> the board  that is to wit  dixon yclept junior of saint mary <eos>
<sos> merciable is with other his fellows lynch and madden  scholars of <eos>
<sos> medicine  and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa  <eos>
<sos> one crotthers  and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at <eos>
<sos> head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long <eos>
<sos> of a mastery of him erewhile gested  and of all them  reserved young <eos>
<sos> stephen  he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead  and <eos>
<sos> beside the meek sir leopold  but on young malachi they waited for that <eos>
<sos> he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how <eos>
<sos> he had broke his avow  and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast <eos>
<sos> friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that <eos>
<sos> his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as <eos>
<sos> they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner  ruth red <eos>
<sos> him  love led on with will to wander  loth to leave  <eos>
<sos> for they were right witty scholars  and he heard their aresouns each <eos>
<sos> gen other as touching birth and righteousness  young madden maintaining <eos>
<sos> that put such case it were hard the wife to die  for so it had fallen <eos>
<sos> out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in horne is house <eos>
<sos> that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next <eos>
<sos> before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her <eos>
<sos> case   and they said farther she should live because in the beginning  <eos>
<sos> they said  the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that <eos>
<sos> were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for <eos>
<sos> he had conscience to let her die  and not few and of these was young <eos>
<sos> lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it <eos>
<sos> was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the <eos>
<sos> law nor his judges did provide no remedy  a redress god grant  this was <eos>
<sos> scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay  by our virgin mother  <eos>
<sos> the wife should live and the babe to die  in colour whereof they waxed <eos>
<sos> hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but <eos>
<sos> the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at <eos>
<sos> the least way mirth might not lack  then young madden showed all the <eos>
<sos> whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion <eos>
<sos> sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint <eos>
<sos> ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby <eos>
<sos> they were all wondrous grieved  to whom young stephen had these words <eos>
<sos> following  murmur  sirs  is eke oft among lay folk  both babe and <eos>
<sos> parent now glorify their maker  the one in limbo gloom  the other in <eos>
<sos> purgefire  but  gramercy  what of those godpossibled souls that we <eos>
<sos> nightly impossibilise  which is the sin against the holy ghost  very <eos>
<sos> god  lord and giver of life  for  sirs  he said  our lust is brief  we <eos>
<sos> are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends <eos>
<sos> than we  then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends  <eos>
<sos> but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was <eos>
<sos> that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or <eos>
<sos> leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead  <eos>
<sos> whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachi is praise of that <eos>
<sos> beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn  the <eos>
<sos> other all this while  pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they <eos>
<sos> did malice him  witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his <eos>
<sos> engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to <eos>
<sos> do  thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir <eos>
<sos> leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour <eos>
<sos> which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare <eos>
<sos> whoso she might be or wheresoever  then spake young stephen orgulous of <eos>
<sos> mother church that would cast him out of her bosom  of law of canons  <eos>
<sos> of lilith  patron of abortions  of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of <eos>
<sos> brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or  as virgilius <eos>
<sos> saith  by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or <eos>
<sos> an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with  _effectu <eos>
<sos> secuto_  or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of <eos>
<sos> averroes and moses maimonides  he said also how at the end of the <eos>
<sos> second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother <eos>
<sos> foldeth ever souls for god is greater glory whereas that earthly mother <eos>
<sos> which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he <eos>
<sos> that holdeth the fisherman is seal  even that blessed peter on which <eos>
<sos> rock was holy church for all ages founded  all they bachelors then <eos>
<sos> asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as <eos>
<sos> risk life to save life  a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted <eos>
<sos> all and  laying hand to jaw  he said dissembling  as his wont was  that <eos>
<sos> as it was informed him  who had ever loved the art of physic as might a <eos>
<sos> layman  and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an <eos>
<sos> accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had <eos>
<sos> birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their <eos>
<sos> questions  that is truth  pardy  said dixon  and  or i err  a pregnant <eos>
<sos> word  which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he <eos>
<sos> averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he <eos>
<sos> was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that <eos>
<sos> taking it appeared eftsoons  <eos>
<sos> but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had <eos>
<sos> pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and <eos>
<sos> as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only <eos>
<sos> manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art <eos>
<sos> could save so dark is destiny  and she was wondrous stricken of heart <eos>
<sos> for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of <eos>
<sos> lamb is wool  the flower of the flock  lest he might perish utterly and <eos>
<sos> lie akeled  for it was then about the midst of the winter  and now sir <eos>
<sos> leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him <eos>
<sos> his friend is son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness <eos>
<sos> and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage  for <eos>
<sos> all accounted him of real parts  so grieved he also in no less measure <eos>
<sos> for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and <eos>
<sos> murdered his goods with whores  <eos>
<sos> about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty <eos>
<sos> so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed <eos>
<sos> their approach from him that still plied it very busily who  praying <eos>
<sos> for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff  he gave them for a pledge <eos>
<sos> the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray  now drink <eos>
<sos> we  quod he  of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed <eos>
<sos> parcel of my body but my soul is bodiment  leave ye fraction of bread to <eos>
<sos> them that live by bread alone  be not afeard neither for any want for <eos>
<sos> this will comfort more than the other will dismay  see ye here  and he <eos>
<sos> showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the <eos>
<sos> worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had  he said  for a song <eos>
<sos> which he writ  they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such <eos>
<sos> dearth of money as was herebefore  his words were then these as <eos>
<sos> followeth  know all men  he said  time is ruins build eternity is <eos>
<sos> mansions  what means this  desire is wind blasts the thorntree but after <eos>
<sos> it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time  mark <eos>
<sos> me now  in woman is womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the <eos>

<sos> the second eve and she won us  saith augustine too  whereas that other  <eos>
<sos> our grandam  which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of <eos>
<sos> navelcords sold us all  seed  breed and generation  for a penny pippin  <eos>
<sos> but here is the matter now  or she knew him  that second i say  and was <eos>
<sos> but creature of her creature  vergine madre  figlia di tuo figlio  or <eos>
<sos> she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy <eos>

<sos> sing a bawdy catch staboo stabella about a wench that was put in pod <eos>

<sos> most worthy to be most sacred  in horne is house rest should reign  <eos>
<sos> to be short this passage was scarce by when master dixon of mary in <eos>
<sos> eccles  goodly grinning  asked young stephen what was the reason why he <eos>
<sos> had not cided to take friar is vows and he answered him obedience in the <eos>
<sos> womb  chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days  master <eos>
<sos> lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds <eos>
<sos> and how  as he heard hereof counted  he had besmirched the lily virtue <eos>
<sos> of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all <eos>
<sos> intershowed it too  waxing merry and toasting to his fathership  but he <eos>
<sos> said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was <eos>
<sos> the eternal son and ever virgin  thereat mirth grew in them the more <eos>
<sos> and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing <eos>
<sos> and deflowering of spouses  as the priests use in madagascar island  <eos>

<sos> paganry  and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as <eos>
<sos> they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before <eos>
<sos> so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart <eos>
<sos> shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that <eos>
<sos> storm  then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard <eos>
<sos> again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he <eos>
<sos> was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour  but the <eos>
<sos> braggart boaster cried that an old nobodaddy was in his cups it was <eos>
<sos> muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead  but this was <eos>
<sos> only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in horne is hall  he <eos>
<sos> drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it <eos>
<sos> thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden  <eos>
<sos> being godly certain whiles  knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of <eos>
<sos> doom and master bloom  at the braggart is side  spoke to him calming <eos>
<sos> words to slumber his great fear  advertising how it was no other thing <eos>
<sos> but a hubbub noise that he heard  the discharge of fluid from the <eos>
<sos> thunderhead  look you  having taken place  and all of the order of a <eos>
<sos> natural phenomenon  <eos>
<sos> but was young boasthard is fear vanquished by calmer is words  no  for he <eos>
<sos> had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be <eos>
<sos> done away  and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the <eos>
<sos> other  he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either  but <eos>
<sos> could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the <eos>
<sos> bottle holiness that then he lived withal  indeed no for grace was not <eos>
<sos> there to find that bottle  heard he then in that clap the voice of the <eos>
<sos> god bringforth or  what calmer said  a hubbub of phenomenon  heard  <eos>
<sos> why  he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube <eos>
<sos> understanding  which he had not done   for through that tube he saw <eos>
<sos> that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one <eos>
<sos> day die as he was like the rest too a passing show  and would he not <eos>
<sos> accept to die like the rest and pass away  by no means would he though <eos>
<sos> he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives <eos>
<sos> which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law  then wotted <eos>
<sos> he nought of that other land which is called believe on me  that is the <eos>
<sos> land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for <eos>
<sos> ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering <eos>
<sos> at which all shall come as many as believe on it  yes  pious had told <eos>
<sos> him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason <eos>
<sos> was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing <eos>
<sos> exterior whose name  she said  is bird in the hand and she beguiled him <eos>
<sos> wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as  <eos>
<sos> ho  you pretty man  turn aside hither and i will show you a brave <eos>
<sos> place  and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot <eos>
<sos> which is named two in the bush or  by some learned  carnal <eos>
<sos> concupiscence  <eos>
<sos> this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of <eos>

<sos> bird in the hand  which was within all foul plagues  monsters and a <eos>
<sos> wicked devil  they would strain the last but they would make at her and <eos>
<sos> know her  for regarding believe on me they said it was nought else but <eos>
<sos> notion and they could conceive no thought of it for  first  <eos>
<sos> two in the bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and <eos>
<sos> in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words <eos>

<sos> cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of <eos>

<sos> of the hindustanish for his farmer is gazette  to have three things in <eos>
<sos> all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and <eos>
<sos> bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their <eos>
<sos> queerities no telling how  <eos>
<sos> with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the <eos>
<sos> letter was in that night is gazette and he made a show to find it about <eos>
<sos> him  for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it  but <eos>
<sos> on stephen is persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit <eos>
<sos> near by which he did mighty brisk  he was a kind of sport gentleman <eos>
<sos> that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of <eos>
<sos> women  horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat  to tell the truth he <eos>
<sos> was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the <eos>
<sos> coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps  ostlers  bookies  paul is men  <eos>
<sos> runners  flatcaps  waistcoateers  ladies of the bagnio and other rogues <eos>
<sos> of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at <eos>
<sos> nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much <eos>
<sos> loose gossip  he took his ordinary at a boilingcook is and if he had but <eos>
<sos> gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a <eos>
<sos> bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his <eos>
<sos> tongue  some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every <eos>
<sos> mother is son of them would burst their sides  the other  costello that <eos>
<sos> is  hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale  faith  no  he <eos>
<sos> says  frank  that was his name    tis all about kerry cows that are to <eos>
<sos> be butchered along of the plague  but they can go hang  says he with a <eos>
<sos> wink  for me with their bully beef  a pox on it  there is as good fish <eos>
<sos> in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take <eos>
<sos> of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the <eos>
<sos> meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his <eos>
<sos> embassy as he was sharpset  mort aux vaches  says frank then in the <eos>
<sos> french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a <eos>
<sos> winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too  from a <eos>
<sos> child this frank had been a donought that his father  a headborough  <eos>
<sos> who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of <eos>
<sos> the globes  matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but <eos>
<sos> he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar <eos>
<sos> with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes  one <eos>
<sos> time he would be a playactor  then a sutler or a welsher  then nought <eos>
<sos> would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main  then he was for <eos>
<sos> the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk  <eos>
<sos> kidnapping a squire is heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids  <eos>
<sos> linen or choking chicken behind a hedge  he had been off as many times <eos>
<sos> as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to <eos>
<sos> his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw <eos>
<sos> him  what  says mr leopold with his hands across  that was earnest to <eos>
<sos> know the drift of it  will they slaughter all  i protest i saw them but <eos>
<sos> this day morning going to the liverpool boats  says he  i can scarce <eos>
<sos> believe  tis so bad  says he  and he had experience of the like brood <eos>
<sos> beasts and of springers  greasy hoggets and wether wool  having been <eos>
<sos> some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe  a worthy salesmaster <eos>
<sos> that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr <eos>
<sos> gavin low is yard in prussia street  i question with you there  says he  <eos>
<sos> more like  tis the hoose or the timber tongue  mr stephen  a little <eos>
<sos> moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had <eos>
<sos> dispatches from the emperor is chief tailtickler thanking him for the <eos>
<sos> hospitality  that was sending over doctor rinderpest  the bestquoted <eos>
<sos> cowcatcher in all muscovy  with a bolus or two of physic to take the <eos>
<sos> bull by the horns  come  come  says mr vincent  plain dealing  he ll <eos>
<sos> find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that is <eos>
<sos> irish  says he  irish by name and irish by nature  says mr stephen  and <eos>
<sos> he sent the ale purling about  an irish bull in an english chinashop  i <eos>
<sos> conceive you  says mr dixon  it is that same bull that was sent to our <eos>
<sos> island by farmer nicholas  the bravest cattlebreeder of them all  with <eos>
<sos> an emerald ring in his nose  true for you  says mr vincent cross the <eos>
<sos> table  and a bullseye into the bargain  says he  and a plumper and a <eos>
<sos> portlier bull  says he  never shit on shamrock  he had horns galore  a <eos>
<sos> coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his <eos>
<sos> nostrils so that the women of our island  leaving doughballs and <eos>
<sos> rollingpins  followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains  <eos>
<sos> what for that  says mr dixon  but before he came over farmer nicholas <eos>
<sos> that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who <eos>
<sos> were no better off than himself  so be off now  says he  and do all my <eos>
<sos> cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmer is blessing  <eos>
<sos> and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly  but the slap and <eos>
<sos> the blessing stood him friend  says mr vincent  for to make up he <eos>
<sos> taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid  wife  abbess <eos>
<sos> and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the <eos>
<sos> month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the <eos>
<sos> nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young <eos>
<sos> ravisher in the four fields of all ireland  another then put in his <eos>
<sos> word  and they dressed him  says he  in a point shift and petticoat <eos>
<sos> with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his <eos>
<sos> forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables <eos>
<sos> for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of <eos>
<sos> the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his <eos>
<sos> heart is content  by this time the father of the faithful  for so they <eos>
<sos> called him  was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture  to <eos>
<sos> remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in <eos>
<sos> their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on <eos>
<sos> his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow <eos>
<sos> out of him in bulls  language and they all after him  ay  says another  <eos>
<sos> and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the <eos>
<sos> land but green grass for himself  for that was the only colour to his <eos>
<sos> mind  and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the <eos>
<sos> island with a printed notice  saying  by the lord harry  green is the <eos>
<sos> grass that grows on the ground  and  says mr dixon  if ever he got <eos>
<sos> scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a <eos>
<sos> husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or <eos>
<sos> a bag of rapeseed out he d run amok over half the countryside rooting <eos>
<sos> up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harry is orders  <eos>
<sos> there was bad blood between them at first  says mr vincent  and the <eos>
<sos> lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an <eos>
<sos> old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and i ll meddle in <eos>
<sos> his matters  says he  i ll make that animal smell hell  says he  with <eos>
<sos> the help of that good pizzle my father left me  but one evening  says <eos>
<sos> mr dixon  when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to <eos>
<sos> dinner after winning a boatrace  he had spade oars for himself but the <eos>
<sos> first rule of the course was that the others were to row with <eos>
<sos> pitchforks  he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and <eos>
<sos> on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he <eos>
<sos> found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous <eos>
<sos> champion bull of the romans  bos bovum  which is good bog latin for <eos>
<sos> boss of the show  after that  says mr vincent  the lord harry put his <eos>
<sos> head into a cow is drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers <eos>
<sos> and pulling it out again told them all his new name  then  with the <eos>
<sos> water running off him  he got into an old smock and skirt that had <eos>
<sos> belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls  language <eos>
<sos> to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first <eos>
<sos> personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if <eos>
<sos> ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write <eos>
<sos> it upon what took his fancy  the side of a rock or a teahouse table or <eos>
<sos> a bale of cotton or a corkfloat  in short  he and the bull of ireland <eos>
<sos> were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt  they were  says mr <eos>
<sos> stephen  and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was <eos>
<sos> toward  as the ungrate women were all of one mind  made a wherry raft  <eos>
<sos> loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard  set all <eos>
<sos> masts erect  manned the yards  sprang their luff  heaved to  spread <eos>
<sos> three sheets in the wind  put her head between wind and water  weighed <eos>
<sos> anchor  ported her helm  ran up the jolly roger  gave three times <eos>
<sos> three  let the bullgine run  pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea <eos>
<sos> to recover the main of america  which was the occasion  says mr <eos>
<sos> vincent  of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty  <eos>
<sos> _ pope peter is but a pissabed  <eos>
<sos> a man is a man for a  that _ <eos>
<sos> our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway <eos>
<sos> as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend <eos>
<sos> whom he had just rencountered  a young gentleman  his name alec bannon  <eos>
<sos> who had late come to town  it being his intention to buy a colour or a <eos>
<sos> cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars  mr mulligan was civil <eos>
<sos> enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a <eos>
<sos> project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched <eos>
<sos> on  whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards <eos>
<sos> which he had had printed that day at mr quinnell is bearing a legend <eos>
<sos> printed in fair italics  _mr malachi mulligan  fertiliser and <eos>
<sos> incubator  lambay island_  his project  as he went on to expound  was <eos>
<sos> to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief <eos>
<sos> business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and <eos>
<sos> to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has <eos>
<sos> been framed  well  let us hear of it  good my friend  said mr dixon  i <eos>
<sos> make no doubt it smacks of wenching  come  be seated  both   tis as <eos>
<sos> cheap sitting as standing  mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and  <eos>
<sos> expatiating upon his design  told his hearers that he had been led into <eos>
<sos> this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility  both the <eos>
<sos> inhibitory and the prohibitory  whether the inhibition in its turn were <eos>
<sos> due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as <eos>
<sos> whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from <eos>
<sos> proclivities acquired  it grieved him plaguily  he said  to see the <eos>
<sos> nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges  and to reflect upon so <eos>
<sos> many agreeable females with rich jointures  a prey to the vilest <eos>
<sos> bonzes  who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial <eos>
<sos> cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some <eos>
<sos> unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness  <eos>
<sos> sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty <eos>
<sos> fellows were at hand to caress  this  he assured them  made his heart <eos>
<sos> weep  to curb this inconvenient  which he concluded due to a <eos>
<sos> suppression of latent heat   having advised with certain counsellors of <eos>
<sos> worth and inspected into this matter  he had resolved to purchase in <eos>
<sos> fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder  lord <eos>
<sos> talbot de malahide  a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our <eos>
<sos> ascendancy party  he proposed to set up there a national fertilising <eos>
<sos> farm to be named omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the <eos>
<sos> fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the <eos>
<sos> fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there <eos>
<sos> direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her <eos>
<sos> natural  money was no object  he said  nor would he take a penny for <eos>
<sos> his pains  the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of <eos>
<sos> fashion  if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm <eos>
<sos> persuaders for their petitions  would find in him their man  for his <eos>
<sos> nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet <eos>
<sos> of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there  the flesh of these <eos>
<sos> latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose  both <eos>
<sos> broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum <eos>
<sos> chillies  after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of <eos>
<sos> asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief <eos>
<sos> with which he had shielded it  they both  it seems  had been overtaken <eos>
<sos> by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water  as <eos>
<sos> might be observed by mr mulligan is smallclothes of a hodden grey which <eos>
<sos> was now somewhat piebald  his project meanwhile was very favourably <eos>
<sos> entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr <eos>
<sos> dixon of mary is excepted to it  asking with a finicking air did he <eos>
<sos> purpose also to carry coals to newcastle  mr mulligan however made <eos>
<sos> court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which  as <eos>
<sos> it dwelt upon his memory  seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of <eos>
<sos> his contention  _talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi  o quirites  ut <eos>
<sos> matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici <eos>
<sos> titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus <eos>
<sos> centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt_  while for those of ruder <eos>
<sos> wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more <eos>
<sos> suitable to their stomach  the buck and doe of the forest glade  the <eos>
<sos> farmyard drake and duck  <eos>
<sos> valuing himself not a little upon his elegance  being indeed a proper <eos>
<sos> man of person  this talkative now applied himself to his dress with <eos>
<sos> animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics <eos>
<sos> while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had <eos>
<sos> advanced  the young gentleman  his friend  overjoyed as he was at a <eos>
<sos> passage that had late befallen him  could not forbear to tell it his <eos>
<sos> nearest neighbour  mr mulligan  now perceiving the table  asked for <eos>
<sos> whom were those loaves and fishes and  seeing the stranger  he made him <eos>
<sos> a civil bow and said  pray  sir  was you in need of any professional <eos>
<sos> assistance we could give  who  upon his offer  thanked him very <eos>
<sos> heartily  though preserving his proper distance  and replied that he <eos>
<sos> was come there about a lady  now an inmate of horne is house  that was <eos>
<sos> in an interesting condition  poor body  from woman is woe  and here he <eos>
<sos> fetched a deep sigh  to know if her happiness had yet taken place  mr <eos>
<sos> dixon  to turn the table  took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether <eos>
<sos> his incipient ventripotence  upon which he rallied him  betokened an <eos>
<sos> ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due  <eos>
<sos> as with the noted physician  mr austin meldon  to a wolf in the <eos>
<sos> stomach  for answer mr mulligan  in a gale of laughter at his smalls  <eos>
<sos> smote himself bravely below the diaphragm  exclaiming with an admirable <eos>
<sos> droll mimic of mother grogan  the most excellent creature of her sex <eos>
<sos> though  tis pity she is a trollop   there is a belly that never bore a <eos>
<sos> bastard  this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth <eos>
<sos> and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight  <eos>
<sos> the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some <eos>
<sos> larum in the antechamber  <eos>
<sos> here the listener who was none other than the scotch student  a little <eos>
<sos> fume of a fellow  blond as tow  congratulated in the liveliest fashion <eos>
<sos> with the young gentleman and  interrupting the narrative at a salient <eos>
<sos> point  having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the <eos>
<sos> obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by <eos>
<sos> a questioning poise of the head  a whole century of polite breeding had <eos>
<sos> not achieved so nice a gesture  to which was united an equivalent but <eos>
<sos> contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was <eos>
<sos> ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it  _mais bien <eos>
<sos> sûr  noble stranger  said he cheerily  et mille compliments_  that <eos>
<sos> you may and very opportunely  there wanted nothing but this cup to <eos>
<sos> crown my felicity  but  gracious heaven  was i left with but a crust in <eos>
<sos> my wallet and a cupful of water from the well  my god  i would accept <eos>
<sos> of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give <eos>
<sos> thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver <eos>
<sos> of good things  with these words he approached the goblet to his lips  <eos>
<sos> took a complacent draught of the cordial  slicked his hair and  opening <eos>
<sos> his bosom  out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband  that very <eos>
<sos> picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein  <eos>
<sos> gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness  ah  monsieur  he <eos>
<sos> said  had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting <eos>
<sos> instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap  a gift for her <eos>
<sos> feastday as she told me prettily  in such an artless disorder  of so <eos>
<sos> melting a tenderness   pon my conscience  even you  monsieur  had been <eos>
<sos> impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands <eos>
<sos> of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever  i declare  i was never <eos>
<sos> so touched in all my life  god  i thank thee  as the author of my days  <eos>
<sos> thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her <eos>
<sos> favours  a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and  having <eos>
<sos> replaced the locket in his bosom  he wiped his eye and sighed again  <eos>
<sos> beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures  how great <eos>
<sos> and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in <eos>
<sos> thrall the free and the bond  the simple swain and the polished <eos>
<sos> coxcomb  the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of <eos>
<sos> maturer years  but indeed  sir  i wander from the point  how mingled <eos>
<sos> and imperfect are all our sublunary joys  maledicity  he exclaimed in <eos>
<sos> anguish  would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my <eos>
<sos> cloak along  i could weep to think of it  then  though it had poured <eos>
<sos> seven showers  we were neither of us a penny the worse  but beshrew me  <eos>
<sos> he cried  clapping hand to his forehead  tomorrow will be a new day <eos>
<sos> and  thousand thunders  i know of a marchand de capotes  monsieur <eos>
<sos> poyntz  from whom i can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the <eos>
<sos> french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting  tut  tut  cries le <eos>
<sos> fécondateur  tripping in  my friend monsieur moore  that most <eos>
<sos> accomplished traveller  i have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in <eos>
<sos> a circle of the best wits of the town   is my authority that in cape <eos>
<sos> horn  ventre biche  they have a rain that will wet through any  even <eos>
<sos> the stoutest cloak  a drenching of that violence  he tells me  _sans <eos>
<sos> blague_  has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest <eos>
<sos> posthaste to another world  pooh  a livre  cries monsieur lynch  the <eos>
<sos> clumsy things are dear at a sou  one umbrella  were it no bigger than a <eos>
<sos> fairy mushroom  is worth ten such stopgaps  no woman of any wit would <eos>
<sos> wear one  my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge <eos>
<sos> before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for  as she <eos>
<sos> reminded me  blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there <eos>
<sos> was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies   dame nature  by the <eos>
<sos> divine blessing  has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a <eos>
<sos> household word that il y a deux choses for which the innocence of our <eos>
<sos> original garb  in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties  is <eos>
<sos> the fittest  nay  the only garment  the first  said she  and here my <eos>
<sos> pretty philosopher  as i handed her to her tilbury  to fix my <eos>
<sos> attention  gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear   <eos>
<sos> the first is a bath    but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall <eos>
<sos> cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of <eos>
<sos> our store of knowledge  <eos>
<sos> amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and  while <eos>
<sos> all were conjecturing what might be the cause  miss callan entered and  <eos>
<sos> having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon  retired with <eos>
<sos> a profound bow to the company  the presence even for a moment among a <eos>
<sos> party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and <eos>
<sos> not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of <eos>
<sos> the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of <eos>
<sos> ribaldry  strike me silly  said costello  a low fellow who was fuddled  <eos>
<sos> a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh  i ll be sworn she has rendezvoused <eos>
<sos> you  what  you dog  have you a way with them  gad is bud  immensely so  <eos>
<sos> said mr lynch  the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater <eos>
<sos> hospice  demme  does not doctor o gargle chuck the nuns there under the <eos>
<sos> chin  as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been <eos>
<sos> wardmaid there any time these seven months  lawksamercy  doctor  cried <eos>
<sos> the young blood in the primrose vest  feigning a womanish simper and <eos>
<sos> with immodest squirmings of his body  how you do tease a body  drat the <eos>
<sos> man  bless me  i am all of a wibbly wobbly  why  you re as bad as dear <eos>
<sos> little father cantekissem  that you are  may this pot of four half <eos>
<sos> choke me  cried costello  if she aint in the family way  i knows a lady <eos>
<sos> what is got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her  the young <eos>
<sos> surgeon  however  rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as <eos>
<sos> the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward  <eos>
<sos> merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings <eos>
<sos> of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable <eos>
<sos> fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy  i want patience  <eos>
<sos> said he  with those who  without wit to enliven or learning to <eos>
<sos> instruct  revile an ennobling profession which  saving the reverence <eos>
<sos> due to the deity  is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth  i <eos>
<sos> am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of <eos>
<sos> witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which  so far <eos>
<sos> from being a byword  should be a glorious incentive in the human <eos>
<sos> breast  i cannot away with them  what  malign such an one  the amiable <eos>
<sos> miss callan  who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of <eos>
<sos> ours  and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child <eos>
<sos> of clay  perish the thought  i shudder to think of the future of a race <eos>
<sos> where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right <eos>
<sos> reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne  having <eos>
<sos> delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and <eos>
<sos> repaired to the door  a murmur of approval arose from all and some were <eos>
<sos> for ejecting the low soaker without more ado  a design which would have <eos>
<sos> been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had <eos>
<sos> he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid <eos>
<sos> imprecation  for he swore a round hand  that he was as good a son of <eos>
<sos> the true fold as ever drew breath  stap my vitals  said he  them was <eos>
<sos> always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most <eos>
<sos> particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand <eos>
<sos> to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks <eos>
<sos> back on with a loving heart  <eos>
<sos> to revert to mr bloom who  after his first entry  had been conscious of <eos>
<sos> some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits <eos>
<sos> of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity  <eos>
<sos> the young sparks  it is true  were as full of extravagancies as <eos>
<sos> overgrown children  the words of their tumultuary discussions were <eos>
<sos> difficultly understood and not often nice  their testiness and <eos>
<sos> outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from  nor were <eos>
<sos> they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of <eos>
<sos> strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf  but the word of mr <eos>
<sos> costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch <eos>
<sos> that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity  born <eos>
<sos> out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into <eos>
<sos> the world  which the dint of the surgeon is pliers in his skull lent <eos>
<sos> indeed a colour to  so as to put him in thought of that missing link of <eos>
<sos> creation is chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin  it was <eos>
<sos> now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had <eos>
<sos> passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and  being of a <eos>
<sos> wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast  he had enjoined his <eos>
<sos> heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and  by intercepting <eos>
<sos> them with the readiest precaution  foster within his breast that <eos>
<sos> plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at  rash judgers scorn <eos>
<sos> and all find tolerable and but tolerable  to those who create <eos>
<sos> themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy  a habit of mind which <eos>
<sos> he never did hold with  to them he would concede neither to bear the <eos>
<sos> name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding  while for such <eos>
<sos> that  having lost all forbearance  can lose no more  there remained the <eos>
<sos> sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a <eos>
<sos> precipitate and inglorious retreat  not but what he could feel with <eos>
<sos> mettlesome youth which  caring nought for the mows of dotards or the <eos>
<sos> gruntlings of the severe  is ever  as the chaste fancy of the holy <eos>
<sos> writer expresses it  for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far <eos>
<sos> forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a <eos>
<sos> gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions  to conclude  while <eos>
<sos> from the sister is words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was  <eos>
<sos> however  it must be owned  not a little alleviated by the intelligence <eos>
<sos> that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now <eos>
<sos> testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the <eos>
<sos> supreme being  <eos>
<sos> accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour  saying that  to express <eos>
<sos> his notion of the thing  his opinion  who ought not perchance to <eos>
<sos> express one  was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid <eos>
<sos> genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her <eos>
<sos> confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers  <eos>
<sos> the dressy young blade said it was her husband is that put her in that <eos>
<sos> expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian <eos>
<sos> matron  i must acquaint you  said mr crotthers  clapping on the table <eos>
<sos> so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis  old glory allelujurum <eos>
<sos> was round again today  an elderly man with dundrearies  preferring <eos>
<sos> through his nose a request to have word of wilhelmina  my life  as he <eos>
<sos> calls her  i bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event <eos>
<sos> would burst anon   slife  i ll be round with you  i cannot but extol <eos>
<sos> the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another <eos>
<sos> child out of her  all fell to praising of it  each after his own <eos>
<sos> fashion  though the same young blade held with his former view that <eos>
<sos> another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap  a clerk in <eos>
<sos> orders  a linkboy  virtuous  or an itinerant vendor of articles needed <eos>
<sos> in every household  singular  communed the guest with himself  the <eos>
<sos> wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them  that <eos>
<sos> the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the <eos>
<sos> seminaries of such frivolity  that the mere acquisition of academic <eos>
<sos> titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of <eos>
<sos> levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise <eos>
<sos> eminent have esteemed the noblest  but  he further added  it is mayhap <eos>
<sos> to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for i have <eos>
<sos> more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together  <eos>
<sos> but with what fitness  let it be asked of the noble lord  his patron  <eos>
<sos> has this alien  whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted <eos>
<sos> to civic rights  constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal <eos>
<sos> polity  where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have <eos>
<sos> counselled  during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary <eos>
<sos> advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that <eos>
<sos> moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a <eos>
<sos> tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per <eos>
<sos> cents  has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received  or is <eos>
<sos> it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own <eos>
<sos> dupe as he is  if report belie him not  his own and his only enjoyer  <eos>
<sos> far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady  <eos>
<sos> the daughter of a gallant major  or to cast the most distant <eos>
<sos> reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there  as it <eos>
<sos> was indeed highly his interest not to have done  then be it so  unhappy <eos>
<sos> woman  she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate <eos>
<sos> prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than <eos>
<sos> the derision of the desperate  he says this  a censor of morals  a very <eos>
<sos> pelican in his piety  who did not scruple  oblivious of the ties of <eos>
<sos> nature  to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn <eos>
<sos> from the lowest strata of society  nay  had the hussy is scouringbrush <eos>
<sos> not been her tutelary angel  it had gone with her as hard as with <eos>
<sos> hagar  the egyptian  in the question of the grazing lands his peevish <eos>
<sos> asperity is notorious and in mr cuffe is hearing brought upon him from <eos>
<sos> an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as <eos>
<sos> straightforward as they were bucolic  it ill becomes him to preach that <eos>
<sos> gospel  has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the <eos>
<sos> want of the ploughshare  a habit reprehensible at puberty is second <eos>
<sos> nature and an opprobrium in middle life  if he must dispense his balm <eos>
<sos> of gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to <eos>
<sos> health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist <eos>
<sos> better with the doctrines that now engross him  his marital breast is <eos>
<sos> the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce  the <eos>
<sos> lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort <eos>
<sos> neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of <eos>
<sos> ills is at his best an exotic tree which  when rooted in its native <eos>
<sos> orient  throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but  <eos>
<sos> transplanted to a clime more temperate  its roots have lost their <eos>
<sos> quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant  <eos>
<sos> acid and inoperative  <eos>
<sos> the news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial <eos>
<sos> usage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the <eos>
<sos> junior medical officer in residence  who in his turn announced to the <eos>
<sos> delegation that an heir had been born  when he had betaken himself to <eos>
<sos> the women is apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the <eos>
<sos> afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic <eos>
<sos> affairs and the members of the privy council  silent in unanimous <eos>
<sos> exhaustion and approbation the delegates  chafing under the length and <eos>
<sos> solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would <eos>
<sos> palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and <eos>
<sos> obstetrician rendered the easier  broke out at once into a strife of <eos>
<sos> tongues  in vain the voice of mr canvasser bloom was heard endeavouring <eos>
<sos> to urge  to mollify  to refrain  the moment was too propitious for the <eos>
<sos> display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union <eos>
<sos> among tempers so divergent  every phase of the situation was <eos>
<sos> successively eviscerated  the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers  <eos>
<sos> the caesarean section  posthumity with respect to the father and  that <eos>
<sos> rarer form  with respect to the mother  the fratricidal case known as <eos>
<sos> the childs murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of mr <eos>
<sos> advocate bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused  <eos>

<sos> spoke  the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep  the prolongation <eos>
<sos> of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the <eos>

<sos> sturzgeburt  the recorded instances of multiseminal  twikindled and <eos>
<sos> monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of <eos>
<sos> consanguineous parents in a word all the cases of human nativity which <eos>
<sos> aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic <eos>
<sos> illustrations  the gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine <eos>
<sos> were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the <eos>
<sos> state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step <eos>
<sos> over a countrystile lest  by her movement  the navelcord should <eos>
<sos> strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a <eos>
<sos> yearning  ardently and ineffectually entertained  to place her hand <eos>
<sos> against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the <eos>
<sos> seat of castigation  the abnormalities of harelip  breastmole  <eos>

<sos> were alleged by one as a prima facie and natural hypothetical <eos>
<sos> explanation of those swineheaded  the case of madame grissel steevens <eos>

<sos> both these views  with such heat as almost carried conviction  the <eos>
<sos> theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes  his <eos>
<sos> authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of <eos>
<sos> the minotaur which the genius of the elegant latin poet has handed down <eos>
<sos> to us in the pages of his metamorphoses  the impression made by his <eos>
<sos> words was immediate but shortlived  it was effaced as easily as it had <eos>
<sos> been evoked by an allocution from mr candidate mulligan in that vein of <eos>
<sos> pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect  postulating as <eos>
<sos> the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man  contemporaneously  <eos>
<sos> a heated argument having arisen between mr delegate madden and mr <eos>
<sos> candidate lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created <eos>
<sos> in the event of one siamese twin predeceasing the other  the difficulty <eos>

<sos> ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what god has <eos>
<sos> joined  <eos>
<sos> but malachias  tale began to freeze them with horror  he conjured up <eos>
<sos> the scene before them  the secret panel beside the chimney slid back <eos>
<sos> and in the recess appeared    haines  which of us did not feel his <eos>
<sos> flesh creep  he had a portfolio full of celtic literature in one hand  <eos>
<sos> in the other a phial marked poison  surprise  horror  loathing were <eos>
<sos> depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin  i <eos>
<sos> anticipated some such reception  he began with an eldritch laugh  for <eos>
<sos> which  it seems  history is to blame  yes  it is true  i am the <eos>
<sos> murderer of samuel childs  and how i am punished  the inferno has no <eos>
<sos> terrors for me  this is the appearance is on me  tare and ages  what <eos>

<sos> he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back  an instant later his head <eos>
<sos> appeared in the door opposite and said  meet me at westland row station <eos>
<sos> at ten past eleven  he was gone  tears gushed from the eyes of the <eos>
<sos> dissipated host  the seer raised his hand to heaven  murmuring  the <eos>
<sos> vendetta of mananaun  the sage repeated  lex talionis  the <eos>
<sos> sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense <eos>

<sos> the mystery was unveiled  haines was the third brother  his real name <eos>
<sos> was childs  the black panther was himself the ghost of his own father  <eos>
<sos> he drank drugs to obliterate  for this relief much thanks  the lonely <eos>

<sos> spider pitches her web in the solitude  the nocturnal rat peers from <eos>
<sos> his hole  a curse is on it  it is haunted  murderer is ground  <eos>
<sos> what is the age of the soul of man  as she hath the virtue of the <eos>
<sos> chameleon to change her hue at every new approach  to be gay with the <eos>
<sos> merry and mournful with the downcast  so too is her age changeable as <eos>
<sos> her mood  no longer is leopold  as he sits there  ruminating  chewing <eos>
<sos> the cud of reminiscence  that staid agent of publicity and holder of a <eos>
<sos> modest substance in the funds  a score of years are blown away  he is <eos>
<sos> young leopold  there  as in a retrospective arrangement  a mirror <eos>

<sos> mother is thought  or it is the same figure  a year or so gone over  in <eos>
<sos> his first hard hat  ah  that was a day    already on the road  a <eos>
<sos> fullfledged traveller for the family firm  equipped with an orderbook  <eos>
<sos> a scented handkerchief  not for show only   his case of bright <eos>
<sos> trinketware  alas  a thing now of the past   and a quiverful of <eos>
<sos> compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out <eos>
<sos> upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin  shyly acknowledging  but <eos>
<sos> the heart  tell me   his studied baisemoins  the scent  the smile  but  <eos>
<sos> more than these  the dark eyes and oleaginous address  brought home at <eos>

<sos> may be sure  is aheating   reading through round horned spectacles some <eos>
<sos> paper from the europe of a month before  but hey  presto  the mirror is <eos>
<sos> breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes  shrivels  dwindles to a <eos>
<sos> tiny speck within the mist  now he is himself paternal and these about <eos>
<sos> him might be his sons  who can say  the wise father knows his own <eos>
<sos> child  he thinks of a drizzling night in hatch street  hard by the <eos>
<sos> bonded stores there  the first  together  she is a poor waif  a child <eos>

<sos> done but hold  back  it must not be  in terror the poor girl flees away <eos>
<sos> through the murk  she is the bride of darkness  a daughter of night  <eos>
<sos> she dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day  no  leopold  name and <eos>

<sos> taken from thee and in vain  no son of thy loins is by thee  there is <eos>
<sos> none now to be for leopold  what leopold was for rudolph  <eos>
<sos> the voices blend and fuse in clouded silence  silence that is the <eos>
<sos> infinite of space  and swiftly  silently the soul is wafted over <eos>
<sos> regions of cycles of generations that have lived  a region where grey <eos>

<sos> hour  shod in sandals of bright gold  coifed with a veil of what do you <eos>
<sos> call it gossamer  it floats  it flows about her starborn flesh and <eos>
<sos> loose it streams  emerald  sapphire  mauve and heliotrope  sustained on <eos>

<sos> francis was reminding stephen of years before when they had been at <eos>
<sos> school together in conmee is time  he asked about glaucon  alcibiades  <eos>
<sos> pisistratus  where were they now  neither knew  you have spoken of the <eos>
<sos> past and its phantoms  stephen said  why think of them  if i call them <eos>
<sos> into life across the waters of lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to <eos>
<sos> my call  who supposes it  i  bous stephanoumenos  bullockbefriending <eos>
<sos> bard  am lord and giver of their life  he encircled his gadding hair <eos>
<sos> with a coronal of vineleaves  smiling at vincent  that answer and those <eos>
<sos> leaves  vincent said to him  will adorn you more fitly when something <eos>
<sos> more  and greatly more  than a capful of light odes can call your <eos>
<sos> genius father  all who wish you well hope this for you  all desire to <eos>
<sos> see you bring forth the work you meditate  to acclaim you <eos>
<sos> stephaneforos  i heartily wish you may not fail them  o no  vincent <eos>
<sos> lenehan said  laying a hand on the shoulder near him  have no fear  he <eos>
<sos> could not leave his mother an orphan  the young man is face grew dark  <eos>
<sos> all could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and <eos>
<sos> of his recent loss  he would have withdrawn from the feast had not the <eos>
<sos> noise of voices allayed the smart  madden had lost five drachmas on <eos>
<sos> sceptre for a whim of the rider is name  lenehan as much more  he told <eos>
<sos> them of the race  the flag fell and  huuh  off  scamper  the mare ran <eos>
<sos> out freshly with o  madden up  she was leading the field  all hearts <eos>
<sos> were beating  even phyllis could not contain herself  she waved her <eos>
<sos> scarf and cried  huzzah  sceptre wins  but in the straight on the run <eos>
<sos> home when all were in close order the dark horse throwaway drew level  <eos>
<sos> reached  outstripped her  all was lost now  phyllis was silent  her <eos>
<sos> eyes were sad anemones  juno  she cried  i am undone  but her lover <eos>
<sos> consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some <eos>
<sos> oval sugarplums which she partook  a tear fell  one only  a whacking <eos>
<sos> fine whip  said lenehan  is w  lane  four winners yesterday and three <eos>
<sos> today  what rider is like him  mount him on the camel or the boisterous <eos>
<sos> buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his  but let us bear it <eos>
<sos> as was the ancient wont  mercy on the luckless  poor sceptre  he said <eos>
<sos> with a light sigh  she is not the filly that she was  never  by this <eos>
<sos> hand  shall we behold such another  by gad  sir  a queen of them  do <eos>
<sos> you remember her  vincent  i wish you could have seen my queen today  <eos>
<sos> vincent said  how young she was and radiant  lalage were scarce fair <eos>
<sos> beside her  in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin  i do not know the <eos>
<sos> right name of it  the chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom  the air <eos>
<sos> drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us  in <eos>
<sos> the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of <eos>
<sos> those buns with corinth fruit in them that periplipomenes sells in his <eos>
<sos> booth near the bridge  but she had nought for her teeth but the arm <eos>
<sos> with which i held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when i <eos>
<sos> pressed too close  a week ago she lay ill  four days on the couch  but <eos>
<sos> today she was free  blithe  mocked at peril  she is more taking then  <eos>
<sos> her posies too  mad romp that she is  she had pulled her fill as we <eos>
<sos> reclined together  and in your ear  my friend  you will not think who <eos>
<sos> met us as we left the field  conmee himself  he was walking by the <eos>
<sos> hedge  reading  i think a brevier book with  i doubt not  a witty <eos>
<sos> letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page  the sweet creature <eos>
<sos> turned all colours in her confusion  feigning to reprove a slight <eos>
<sos> disorder in her dress  a slip of underwood clung there for the very <eos>
<sos> trees adore her  when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo <eos>
<sos> in that little mirror she carries  but he had been kind  in going by he <eos>
<sos> had blessed us  the gods too are ever kind  lenehan said  if i had poor <eos>
<sos> luck with bass is mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more <eos>
<sos> propensely  he was laying his hand upon a winejar  malachi saw it and <eos>
<sos> withheld his act  pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label  <eos>
<sos> warily  malachi whispered  preserve a druid silence  his soul is far <eos>
<sos> away  it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be <eos>
<sos> born  any object  intensely regarded  may be a gate of access to the <eos>
<sos> incorruptible eon of the gods  do you not think it  stephen  theosophos <eos>
<sos> told me so  stephen answered  whom in a previous existence egyptian <eos>
<sos> priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law  the lords of the <eos>
<sos> moon  theosophos told me  an orangefiery shipload from planet alpha of <eos>
<sos> the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were <eos>
<sos> therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second <eos>
<sos> constellation  <eos>
<sos> however  as a matter of fact though  the preposterous surmise about him <eos>
<sos> being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which <eos>
<sos> was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character  was <eos>
<sos> not the case at all  the individual whose visual organs while the above <eos>
<sos> was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of <eos>
<sos> animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody <eos>
<sos> that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty <eos>
<sos> speedily in the wrong shop  during the past four minutes or thereabouts <eos>
<sos> he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled <eos>
<sos> by messrs bass and co at burton on trent which happened to be situated <eos>
<sos> amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was <eos>
<sos> certainly calculated to attract anyone is remark on account of its <eos>
<sos> scarlet appearance  he was simply and solely  as it subsequently <eos>
<sos> transpired for reasons best known to himself  which put quite an <eos>
<sos> altogether different complexion on the proceedings  after the moment <eos>
<sos> before is observations about boyhood days and the turf  recollecting two <eos>
<sos> or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as <eos>
<sos> mutually innocent of as the babe unborn  eventually  however  both <eos>
<sos> their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other <eos>
<sos> was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily <eos>
<sos> determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the <eos>
<sos> neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid <eos>
<sos> sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out <eos>
<sos> with  also at the same time  however  a considerable degree of <eos>
<sos> attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it <eos>
<sos> about the place  <eos>
<sos> the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the <eos>
<sos> course of life  neither place nor council was lacking in dignity  the <eos>
<sos> debaters were the keenest in the land  the theme they were engaged on <eos>
<sos> the loftiest and most vital  the high hall of horne is house had never <eos>
<sos> beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old <eos>
<sos> rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so <eos>
<sos> encyclopaedic  a gallant scene in truth it made  crotthers was there at <eos>
<sos> the foot of the table in his striking highland garb  his face glowing <eos>
<sos> from the briny airs of the mull of galloway  there too  opposite to <eos>
<sos> him  was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early <eos>
<sos> depravity and premature wisdom  next the scotchman was the place <eos>
<sos> assigned to costello  the eccentric  while at his side was seated in <eos>
<sos> stolid repose the squat form of madden  the chair of the resident <eos>
<sos> indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the <eos>
<sos> figure of bannon in explorer is kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide <eos>
<sos> brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred <eos>
<sos> manners of malachi roland st john mulligan  lastly at the head of the <eos>
<sos> board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of <eos>
<sos> pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of <eos>
<sos> socratic discussion  while to right and left of him were accommodated <eos>
<sos> the flippant prognosticator  fresh from the hippodrome  and that <eos>
<sos> vigilant wanderer  soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained <eos>
<sos> by the mire of an indelible dishonour  but from whose steadfast and <eos>
<sos> constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever <eos>
<sos> efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired <eos>
<sos> pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come  <eos>
<sos> it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted <eos>
<sos> transcendentalism to which mr s  dedalus   div  scep   contentions <eos>
<sos> would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter <eos>
<sos> to accepted scientific methods  science  it cannot be too often <eos>
<sos> repeated  deals with tangible phenomena  the man of science like the <eos>
<sos> man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked <eos>
<sos> and explain them as best he can  there may be  it is true  some <eos>
<sos> questions which science cannot answer at present such as the first <eos>
<sos> problem submitted by mr l  bloom  pubb  canv   regarding the future <eos>
<sos> determination of sex  must we accept the view of empedocles of <eos>
<sos> trinacria that the right ovary  the postmenstrual period  assert <eos>
<sos> others  is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long <eos>
<sos> neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is <eos>
<sos> it  as most embryologists incline to opine  such as culpepper  <eos>
<sos> spallanzani  blumenbach  lusk  hertwig  leopold and valenti  a mixture <eos>
<sos> of both  this would be tantamount to a cooperation  one of nature is <eos>
<sos> favourite devices  between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm on <eos>
<sos> the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position  _succubitus <eos>
<sos> felix_  of the passive element  the other problem raised by the same <eos>
<sos> inquirer is scarcely less vital  infant mortality  it is interesting <eos>
<sos> because  as he pertinently remarks  we are all born in the same way but <eos>
<sos> we all die in different ways  mr m  mulligan  hyg  et eug  doc   blames <eos>
<sos> the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract <eos>
<sos> adenoids  pulmonary complaints etc  by inhaling the bacteria which lurk <eos>
<sos> in dust  these factors  he alleged  and the revolting spectacles <eos>
<sos> offered by our streets  hideous publicity posters  religious ministers <eos>
<sos> of all denominations  mutilated soldiers and sailors  exposed scorbutic <eos>
<sos> cardrivers  the suspended carcases of dead animals  paranoic bachelors <eos>
<sos> and unfructified duennas these  he said  were accountable for any and <eos>
<sos> every fallingoff in the calibre of the race  kalipedia  he prophesied  <eos>
<sos> would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life  genuinely <eos>
<sos> good music  agreeable literature  light philosophy  instructive <eos>
<sos> pictures  plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as <eos>
<sos> venus and apollo  artistic coloured photographs of prize babies  all <eos>
<sos> these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular <eos>
<sos> condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner  mr <eos>
<sos> j  crotthers  disc  bacc   attributes some of these demises to <eos>
<sos> abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy <eos>
<sos> labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by <eos>
<sos> far the vast majority to neglect  private or official  culminating in <eos>
<sos> the exposure of newborn infants  the practice of criminal abortion or <eos>
<sos> in the atrocious crime of infanticide  although the former  we are <eos>
<sos> thinking of neglect  is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of <eos>
<sos> nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too <eos>
<sos> rare to be normative  in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder <eos>
<sos> is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do  <eos>
<sos> all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which <eos>
<sos> often baulk nature in her intentions  an ingenious suggestion is that <eos>
<sos> thrown out by mr v  lynch  bacc  arith   that both natality and <eos>
<sos> mortality  as well as all other phenomena of evolution  tidal <eos>
<sos> movements  lunar phases  blood temperatures  diseases in general  <eos>
<sos> everything  in fine  in nature is vast workshop from the extinction of <eos>
<sos> some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which <eos>
<sos> beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet <eos>
<sos> unascertained  still the plain straightforward question why a child of <eos>
<sos> normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly <eos>
<sos> looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood  though other <eos>
<sos> children of the same marriage do not  must certainly  in the poet is <eos>
<sos> words  give us pause  nature  we may rest assured  has her own good and <eos>
<sos> cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths <eos>
<sos> are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous <eos>
<sos> germs have taken up their residence  modern science has conclusively <eos>
<sos> shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal  tend <eos>
<sos> to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development  an <eos>
<sos> arrangement which  though productive of pain to some of our feelings <eos>
<sos>  notably the maternal   is nevertheless  some of us think  in the long <eos>
<sos> run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival <eos>
<sos> of the fittest  mr s  dedalus   div  scep   remark  or should it be <eos>
<sos> called an interruption   that an omnivorous being which can masticate  <eos>
<sos> deglute  digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with <eos>
<sos> pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous <eos>
<sos> females emaciated by parturition  corpulent professional gentlemen  not <eos>
<sos> to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns  might possibly <eos>
<sos> find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob  reveals <eos>
<sos> as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above <eos>
<sos> alluded to  for the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately <eos>
<sos> acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this <eos>
<sos> morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening <eos>
<sos> bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid <eos>
<sos> from an alkali prides himself on being  it should perhaps be stated <eos>
<sos> that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed <eos>
<sos> victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly <eos>
<sos> dropped from its mother  in a recent public controversy with mr l  <eos>
<sos> bloom  pubb  canv   which took place in the commons  hall of the <eos>
<sos> national maternity hospital  29  30 and 31 holles street  of which  as <eos>
<sos> is well known  dr a  horne  lic  in midw   f  k  q  c  p  i   is the <eos>
<sos> able and popular master  he is reported by eyewitnesses as having <eos>
<sos> stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag  an esthete is <eos>
<sos> allusion  presumably  to one of the most complicated and marvellous of <eos>
<sos> all nature is processes the act of sexual congress  she must let it out <eos>
<sos> again or give it life  as he phrased it  to save her own  at the risk <eos>
<sos> of her own  was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor  none the <eos>
<sos> less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was <eos>
<sos> delivered  <eos>
<sos> meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a <eos>
<sos> happy accouchement  it had been a weary weary while both for patient <eos>
<sos> and doctor  all that surgical skill could do was done and the brave <eos>
<sos> woman had manfully helped  she had  she had fought the good fight and <eos>
<sos> now she was very very happy  those who have passed on  who have gone <eos>
<sos> before  are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching <eos>
<sos> scene  reverently look at her as she reclines there with the <eos>
<sos> motherlight in her eyes  that longing hunger for baby fingers  a pretty <eos>
<sos> sight it is to see   in the first bloom of her new motherhood  <eos>
<sos> breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to one above  the universal <eos>
<sos> husband  and as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one <eos>
<sos> blessing more  to have her dear doady there with her to share her joy  <eos>
<sos> to lay in his arms that mite of god is clay  the fruit of their lawful <eos>
<sos> embraces  he is older now  you and i may whisper it  and a trifle <eos>
<sos> stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity <eos>

<sos> there are sins or  let us call them as the world calls them  evil <eos>

<sos> dim  let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade <eos>
<sos> himself that they were not or at least were otherwise  yet a chance <eos>
<sos> word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront <eos>
<sos> him in the most various circumstances  a vision or a dream  or while <eos>
<sos> timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility <eos>
<sos> of the evening or at the feast  at midnight  when he is now filled with <eos>
<sos> wine  not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies <eos>
<sos> under her wrath  not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but <eos>
<sos> shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past  silent  remote  <eos>
<sos> reproachful  <eos>
<sos> the stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of <eos>
<sos> that false calm there  imposed  as it seemed  by habit or some studied <eos>
<sos> trick  upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an <eos>
<sos> unhealthiness  a flair  for the cruder things of life  a scene <eos>
<sos> disengages itself in the observer is memory  evoked  it would seem  by a <eos>
<sos> word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present <eos>

<sos> alert shock  and yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at <eos>
<sos> times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood  <eos>

<sos> and palm corny kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the <eos>
<sos> sleep to continue for what else is to be done  with a slow nod bloom <eos>
<sos> conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what stephen needs  the car <eos>

<sos> hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo <eos>
<sos> lay  bloom  holding in his hand stephen is hat  festooned with shavings  <eos>
<sos> and ashplant  stands irresolute  then he bends to him and shakes him by <eos>
<sos> the shoulder  _ <eos>
<sos> bloom  eh  ho   there is no answer  he bends again   mr dedalus  <eos>
<sos>  there is no answer   the name if you call  somnambulist  _ he bends <eos>
<sos> again and  hesitating  brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate <eos>

<sos> stretches himself  then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels  _ <eos>

<sos> buttons of stephen is waistcoat   to breathe   he brushes the <eos>
<sos> woodshavings from stephen is clothes with light hand and fingers  _ one <eos>
<sos> pound seven  not hurt anyhow   he listens   what  <eos>

<sos> _ he stretches out his arms  sighs again and curls his body  bloom  <eos>
<sos> holding the hat and ashplant  stands erect  a dog barks in the <eos>
<sos> distance  bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant  he looks <eos>
<sos> down on stephen is face and form  _ <eos>
<sos> bloom   communes with the night   face reminds me of his poor mother  <eos>
<sos> in the shady wood  the deep white breast  ferguson  i think i caught  a <eos>
<sos> girl  some girl  best thing could happen him   he murmurs      swear <eos>
<sos> that i will always hail  ever conceal  never reveal  any part or parts  <eos>

<sos> _ silent  thoughtful  alert he stands on guard  his fingers at his lips <eos>
<sos> in the attitude of secret master  against the dark wall a figure <eos>
<sos> appears slowly  a fairy boy of eleven  a changeling  kidnapped  dressed <eos>
<sos> in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet  holding a <eos>

<sos>   iii   <eos>
<sos>   16   <eos>
<sos> preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of <eos>
<sos> the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up <eos>
<sos> generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed  his <eos>
<sos>  stephen is  mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a <eos>
<sos> bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr <eos>
<sos> bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry <eos>
<sos> water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit <eos>
<sos> upon an expedient by suggesting  off the reel  the propriety of the <eos>
<sos> cabman is shelter  as it was called  hardly a stonesthrow away near butt <eos>
<sos> bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk <eos>
<sos> and soda or a mineral  but how to get there was the rub  for the nonce <eos>
<sos> he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon <eos>
<sos> him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and <eos>
<sos> means during which stephen repeatedly yawned  so far as he could see he <eos>
<sos> was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly <eos>
<sos> advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in <eos>
<sos> their then condition  both of them being e d ed  particularly stephen  <eos>
<sos> always assuming that there was such a thing to be found  accordingly <eos>
<sos> after a few such preliminaries as brushing  in spite of his having <eos>
<sos> forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had <eos>
<sos> done yeoman service in the shaving line  they both walked together <eos>
<sos> along beaver street or  more properly  lane as far as the farrier is and <eos>
<sos> the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of <eos>
<sos> montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence <eos>
<sos> debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergin is  but <eos>
<sos> as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for <eos>
<sos> hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler  probably engaged by some <eos>
<sos> fellows inside on the spree  outside the north star hotel and there was <eos>
<sos> no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom  who was <eos>
<sos> anything but a professional whistler  endeavoured to hail it by <eos>
<sos> emitting a kind of a whistle  holding his arms arched over his head  <eos>
<sos> twice  <eos>
<sos> this was a quandary but  bringing common sense to bear on it  evidently <eos>
<sos> there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it <eos>
<sos> which they accordingly did  so  bevelling around by mullett is and the <eos>
<sos> signal house which they shortly reached  they proceeded perforce in the <eos>
<sos> direction of amiens street railway terminus  mr bloom being handicapped <eos>
<sos> by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had  <eos>
<sos> to vary the timehonoured adage  gone the way of all buttons though  <eos>
<sos> entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing  he heroically made <eos>
<sos> light of the mischance  so as neither of them were particularly pressed <eos>
<sos> for time  as it happened  and the temperature refreshing since it <eos>
<sos> cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius  they <eos>
<sos> dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a <eos>
<sos> fare or a jarvey  as it so happened a dublin united tramways company is <eos>
<sos> sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his <eos>
<sos> companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of <eos>
<sos> some little while back  they passed the main entrance of the great <eos>
<sos> northern railway station  the starting point for belfast  where of <eos>
<sos> course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the <eos>
<sos> backdoor of the morgue  a not very enticing locality  not to say <eos>
<sos> gruesome to a degree  more especially at night  ultimately gained the <eos>
<sos> dock tavern and in due course turned into store street  famous for its <eos>
<sos> c division police station  between this point and the high at present <eos>
<sos> unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen  <eos>
<sos> associated with baird is the stonecutter is in his mind somehow in talbot <eos>
<sos> place  first turning on the right  while the other who was acting as <eos>
<sos> his fidus achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of <eos>
<sos> james rourke is city bakery  situated quite close to where they were  <eos>
<sos> the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread  of all commodities <eos>
<sos> of the public the primary and most indispensable  bread  the staff of <eos>
<sos> life  earn your bread  o tell me where is fancy bread  at rourke is the <eos>
<sos> baker is it is said  <eos>
<sos> en route to his taciturn and  not to put too fine a point on it  not <eos>
<sos> yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in <eos>
<sos> complete possession of his faculties  never more so  in fact <eos>
<sos> disgustingly sober  spoke a word of caution re the dangers of <eos>
<sos> nighttown  women of ill fame and swell mobsmen  which  barely <eos>
<sos> permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice  was of <eos>
<sos> the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age <eos>
<sos> particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence <eos>
<sos> of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as <eos>
<sos> even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if <eos>
<sos> you did not look out  highly providential was the appearance on the <eos>
<sos> scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for <eos>
<sos> that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might <eos>
<sos> have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or  <eos>
<sos> failing that  the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day <eos>
<sos> before mr tobias or  he being the solicitor rather  old wall  he meant <eos>
<sos> to say  or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got <eos>
<sos> bruited about  the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those <eos>
<sos> policemen  whom he cordially disliked  were admittedly unscrupulous in <eos>
<sos> the service of the crown and  as mr bloom put it  recalling a case or <eos>
<sos> two in the a division in clanbrassil street  prepared to swear a hole <eos>
<sos> through a ten gallon pot  never on the spot when wanted but in quiet <eos>
<sos> parts of the city  pembroke road for example  the guardians of the law <eos>
<sos> were well in evidence  the obvious reason being they were paid to <eos>
<sos> protect the upper classes  another thing he commented on was equipping <eos>
<sos> soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off <eos>
<sos> at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians <eos>
<sos> should by any chance they fall out over anything  you frittered away <eos>
<sos> your time  he very sensibly maintained  and health and also character <eos>
<sos> besides which  the squandermania of the thing  fast women of the <eos>
<sos> demimonde ran away with a lot of    s  d  into the bargain and the <eos>
<sos> greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though  touching the <eos>
<sos> much vexed question of stimulants  he relished a glass of choice old <eos>
<sos> wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing <eos>
<sos> aperient virtues  notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch <eos>
<sos> believer in  still never beyond a certain point where he invariably <eos>
<sos> drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of <eos>
<sos> your being at the tender mercy of others practically  most of all he <eos>
<sos> commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting <eos>
<sos> confrères but one  a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his <eos>
<sos> brother medicos under all the circs  <eos>
<sos>  and that one was judas  stephen said  who up to then had said nothing <eos>
<sos> whatsoever of any kind  <eos>
<sos> discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back <eos>
<sos> of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a <eos>
<sos> brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one <eos>
<sos> attracted their rather lagging footsteps  stephen of his own accord <eos>
<sos> stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren <eos>
<sos> cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just <eos>
<sos> make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom <eos>
<sos> of the sentrybox  he began to remember that this had happened or had <eos>
<sos> been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small <eos>
<sos> effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a <eos>
<sos> quondam friend of his father is  gumley  to avoid a meeting he drew <eos>
<sos> nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge  <eos>
<sos>  someone saluted you  mr bloom said  <eos>
<sos> a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches <eos>
<sos> saluted again  calling  <eos>
<sos>  night  <eos>
<sos> stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the <eos>
<sos> compliment  mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch <eos>
<sos> as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but <eos>
<sos> nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety <eos>
<sos> though not funkyish in the least  though unusual in the dublin area he <eos>
<sos> knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next <eos>
<sos> to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising <eos>
<sos> peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some <eos>
<sos> secluded spot outside the city proper  famished loiterers of the thames <eos>
<sos> embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply <eos>
<sos> marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell <eos>
<sos> swoop at a moment is notice  your money or your life  leaving you there <eos>
<sos> to point a moral  gagged and garrotted  <eos>
<sos> stephen  that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters  <eos>
<sos> though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corley is <eos>
<sos> breath redolent of rotten cornjuice  lord john corley some called him <eos>
<sos> and his genealogy came about in this wise  he was the eldest son of <eos>
<sos> inspector corley of the g division  lately deceased  who had married a <eos>
<sos> certain katherine brophy  the daughter of a louth farmer  his <eos>
<sos> grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of <eos>
<sos> a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine  also  talbot  <eos>
<sos> rumour had it  though not proved  that she descended from the house of <eos>
<sos> the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion  really an unquestionably <eos>
<sos> fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing  her mother or aunt or <eos>
<sos> some relative  a woman  as the tale went  of extreme beauty  had <eos>
<sos> enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen  this <eos>
<sos> therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though <eos>
<sos> dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with <eos>
<sos> facetious proclivities as lord john corley  <eos>
<sos> taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell  <eos>
<sos> not as much as a farthing to purchase a night is lodgings  his friends <eos>
<sos> had all deserted him  furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called <eos>
<sos> him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of <eos>
<sos> other uncalledfor expressions  he was out of a job and implored of <eos>
<sos> stephen to tell him where on god is earth he could get something  <eos>
<sos> anything at all  to do  no  it was the daughter of the mother in the <eos>
<sos> washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they <eos>
<sos> were connected through the mother in some way  both occurrences <eos>
<sos> happening at the same time if the whole thing was not a complete <eos>
<sos> fabrication from start to finish  anyhow he was all in  <eos>
<sos>  i would not ask you only  pursued he  on my solemn oath and god knows <eos>
<sos> i am on the rocks  <eos>
<sos>  there ll be a job tomorrow or next day  stephen told him  in a boys  <eos>
<sos> school at dalkey for a gentleman usher  mr garrett deasy  try it  you <eos>
<sos> may mention my name  <eos>
<sos>  ah  god  corley replied  sure i could not teach in a school  man  i was <eos>
<sos> never one of your bright ones  he added with a half laugh  i got stuck <eos>
<sos> twice in the junior at the christian brothers  <eos>
<sos>  i have no place to sleep myself  stephen informed him  <eos>
<sos> corley at the first go off was inclined to suspect it was something to <eos>
<sos> do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody <eos>
<sos> tart off the street  there was a dosshouse in marlborough street  mrs <eos>
<sos> maloney is  but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but <eos>
<sos> m conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over <eos>
<sos> in winetavern street  which was distantly suggestive to the person <eos>
<sos> addressed of friar bacon  for a bob  he was starving too though he <eos>
<sos> had not said a word about it  <eos>
<sos> though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it <eos>
<sos> still stephen is feelings got the better of him in a sense though he <eos>
<sos> knew that corley is brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was <eos>
<sos> hardly deserving of much credence  however _haud ignarus malorum <eos>
<sos> miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the latin poet remarks especially <eos>
<sos> as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the <eos>
<sos> month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of <eos>
<sos> fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished  but the cream <eos>
<sos> of the joke was nothing would get it out of corley is head that he was <eos>
<sos> living in affluence and had not a thing to do but hand out the needful  <eos>
<sos> whereas  he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of <eos>
<sos> finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a <eos>
<sos> bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get <eos>
<sos> sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for  to his <eos>
<sos> chagrin  he found his cash missing  a few broken biscuits were all the <eos>
<sos> result of his investigation  he tried his hardest to recollect for the <eos>
<sos> moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in <eos>
<sos> that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout  very much the reverse <eos>
<sos> in fact  he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough <eos>
<sos> search though he tried to recollect  about biscuits he dimly <eos>
<sos> remembered  who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did <eos>
<sos> he buy  however in another pocket he came across what he surmised in <eos>
<sos> the dark were pennies  erroneously however  as it turned out  <eos>
<sos>  those are halfcrowns  man  corley corrected him  <eos>
<sos> and so in point of fact they turned out to be  stephen anyhow lent him <eos>
<sos> one of them  <eos>
<sos>  thanks  corley answered  you re a gentleman  i ll pay you back one <eos>
<sos> time  who is that with you  i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse <eos>
<sos> in camden street with boylan  the billsticker  you might put in a good <eos>
<sos> word for us to get me taken on there  i d carry a sandwichboard only <eos>
<sos> the girl in the office told me they re full up for the next three <eos>
<sos> weeks  man  god  you ve to book ahead  man  you d think it was for the <eos>
<sos> carl rosa  i do not give a shite anyway so long as i get a job  even as <eos>
<sos> a crossing sweeper  <eos>
<sos> subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six <eos>
<sos> he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky <eos>
<sos> that he said stephen knew well out of fullam is  the shipchandler is  <eos>
<sos> bookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagle is back with <eos>
<sos> o mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe  anyhow he <eos>
<sos> was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and <eos>
<sos> disorderly and refusing to go with the constable  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the <eos>
<sos> cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation <eos>
<sos> watchman is sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work  it struck him  <eos>
<sos> was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own <eos>
<sos> private account while dublin slept  he threw an odd eye at the same <eos>
<sos> time now and then at stephen is anything but immaculately attired <eos>
<sos> interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though <eos>
<sos> where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the <eos>
<sos> remotest idea when  being a levelheaded individual who could give <eos>
<sos> points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on <eos>
<sos> his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally <eos>
<sos> testifying to a chronic impecuniosity  palpably he was one of his <eos>
<sos> hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one <eos>
<sos> preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round  in every deep  so to put <eos>
<sos> it  a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street <eos>
<sos> chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the <eos>
<sos> option of a fine would be a very rara avis altogether  in any case he <eos>
<sos> had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that <eos>
<sos> hour of the night or morning  pretty thick that was certainly  <eos>
<sos> the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who  with his <eos>
<sos> practised eye  was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the <eos>
<sos> blandiloquence of the other parasite  alluding to the encounter he <eos>
<sos> said  laughingly  stephen  that is  <eos>
<sos>  he is down on his luck  he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named <eos>
<sos> boylan  a billsticker  to give him a job as a sandwichman  <eos>
<sos> at this intelligence  in which he seemingly evinced little interest  mr <eos>
<sos> bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the <eos>
<sos> direction of a bucketdredger  rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana  <eos>
<sos> moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair  <eos>
<sos> whereupon he observed evasively  <eos>
<sos>  everybody gets their own ration of luck  they say  now you mention it <eos>
<sos> his face was familiar to me  but  leaving that for the moment  how much <eos>
<sos> did you part with  he queried  if i am not too inquisitive  <eos>
<sos>  half a crown  stephen responded  i daresay he needs it to sleep <eos>
<sos> somewhere  <eos>
<sos>  needs  mr bloom ejaculated  professing not the least surprise at the <eos>
<sos> intelligence  i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he <eos>
<sos> invariably does  everyone according to his needs or everyone according <eos>
<sos> to his deeds  but  talking about things in general  where  added he <eos>
<sos> with a smile  will you sleep yourself  walking to sandycove is out of <eos>
<sos> the question  and even supposing you did you wo not get in after what <eos>
<sos> occurred at westland row station  simply fag out there for nothing  i <eos>
<sos> do not mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why <eos>
<sos> did you leave your father is house  <eos>
<sos>  to seek misfortune  was stephen is answer  <eos>
<sos>  i met your respected father on a recent occasion  mr bloom <eos>
<sos> diplomatically returned  today in fact  or to be strictly accurate  on <eos>
<sos> yesterday  where does he live at present  i gathered in the course of <eos>
<sos> conversation that he had moved  <eos>
<sos>  i believe he is in dublin somewhere  stephen answered unconcernedly  <eos>
<sos> why  <eos>
<sos>  a gifted man  mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior  in more respects <eos>
<sos> than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one  he takes great <eos>
<sos> pride  quite legitimate  out of you  you could go back perhaps  he <eos>
<sos> hasarded  still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row <eos>
<sos> terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two  mulligan  <eos>
<sos> that is  and that english tourist friend of his  who eventually euchred <eos>
<sos> their third companion  were patently trying as if the whole bally <eos>
<sos> station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion  <eos>
<sos> which they did  <eos>
<sos> there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however  such as it <eos>
<sos> was  stephen is mind is eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his <eos>
<sos> family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by <eos>
<sos> the ingle  her hair hanging down  waiting for some weak trinidad shell <eos>
<sos> cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he <eos>
<sos> could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings <eos>
<sos> they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy  boody and <eos>
<sos> katey  the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells <eos>
<sos> and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper  in <eos>
<sos> accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on <eos>
<sos> the days commanded  it being quarter tense or if not  ember days or <eos>
<sos> something like that  <eos>
<sos>  no  mr bloom repeated again  i would not personally repose much trust <eos>
<sos> in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element  <eos>
<sos> dr mulligan  as a guide  philosopher and friend if i were in your <eos>
<sos> shoes  he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all <eos>
<sos> probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals  <eos>
<sos> of course you did not notice as much as i did  but it would not occasion <eos>
<sos> me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic <eos>
<sos> was put in your drink for some ulterior object  <eos>
<sos> he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a <eos>
<sos> versatile allround man  by no means confined to medicine only  who was <eos>
<sos> rapidly coming to the fore in his line and  if the report was verified  <eos>
<sos> bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future <eos>
<sos> as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services <eos>
<sos> in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from <eos>
<sos> certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid <eos>
<sos> at skerries  or malahide was it   was  he was bound to admit  an <eos>
<sos> exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise  so that <eos>
<sos> frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be <eos>
<sos> at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or <eos>
<sos> jealousy  pure and simple  <eos>
<sos>  except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking <eos>
<sos> your brains  he ventured to throw out  <eos>
<sos> the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by <eos>
<sos> friendliness which he gave at stephen is at present morose expression of <eos>
<sos> features did not throw a flood of light  none at all in fact on the <eos>
<sos> problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge <eos>
<sos> by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about <eos>
<sos> saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to <eos>
<sos> himself allowed matters to more or less  grinding poverty did have that <eos>
<sos> effect and he more than conjectured that  high educational abilities <eos>
<sos> though he possessed  he experienced no little difficulty in making both <eos>
<sos> ends meet  <eos>
<sos> adjacent to the men is public urinal they perceived an icecream car <eos>
<sos> round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were <eos>
<sos> getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a <eos>
<sos> particularly animated way  there being some little differences between <eos>
<sos> the parties  <eos>
<sos>  puttana madonna  che ci dia i quattrini  ho ragione  culo rotto  <eos>
<sos>  intendiamoci  mezzo sovrano più    <eos>
<sos>  dice lui  però  <eos>
<sos>  mezzo  <eos>
<sos>  farabutto  mortacci sui  <eos>
<sos>  ma ascolta  cinque la testa più    <eos>
<sos> mr bloom and stephen entered the cabman is shelter  an unpretentious <eos>
<sos> wooden structure  where  prior to then  he had rarely if ever been <eos>
<sos> before  the former having previously whispered to the latter a few <eos>
<sos> hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skin the goat <eos>
<sos> fitzharris  the invincible  though he could not vouch for the actual <eos>
<sos> facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in  a few <eos>
<sos> moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet <eos>
<sos> corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous <eos>
<sos> collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the <eos>
<sos> genus homo already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified <eos>
<sos> by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked <eos>
<sos> curiosity  <eos>
<sos>  now touching a cup of coffee  mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest <eos>
<sos> to break the ice  it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the <eos>
<sos> shape of solid food  say  a roll of some description  <eos>
<sos> accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order <eos>
<sos> these commodities quietly  the hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores or <eos>
<sos> whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes <eos>
<sos> apparently dissatisfied  away though one redbearded bibulous <eos>
<sos> individual  portion of whose hair was greyish  a sailor probably  still <eos>
<sos> stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention <eos>
<sos> to the floor  mr bloom  availing himself of the right of free speech  <eos>
<sos> he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute  <eos>
<sos> though  to be sure  rather in a quandary over voglio  remarked to his <eos>
<sos> protégé in an audible tone of voice à propos of the battle royal in <eos>
<sos> the street which was still raging fast and furious  <eos>
<sos>  a beautiful language  i mean for singing purposes  why do you not <eos>
<sos> write your poetry in that language  bella poetria  it is so melodious <eos>
<sos> and full  belladonna  voglio  <eos>
<sos> stephen  who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could  suffering <eos>
<sos> from lassitude generally  replied  <eos>
<sos>  to fill the ear of a cow elephant  they were haggling over money  <eos>
<sos>  is that so  mr bloom asked  of course  he subjoined pensively  at the <eos>
<sos> inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were <eos>
<sos> absolutely necessary  it may be only the southern glamour that <eos>
<sos> surrounds it  <eos>
<sos> the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tête à tête put a <eos>
<sos> boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the <eos>
<sos> table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun  or so it seemed  <eos>
<sos> after which he beat a retreat to his counter  mr bloom determining to <eos>
<sos> have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to  for <eos>
<sos> which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he <eos>
<sos> did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was <eos>
<sos> temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him  <eos>
<sos>  sounds are impostures  stephen said after a pause of some little time  <eos>
<sos> like names  cicero  podmore  napoleon  mr goodbody  jesus  mr doyle  <eos>
<sos> shakespeares were as common as murphies  what is in a name  <eos>
<sos>  yes  to be sure  mr bloom unaffectedly concurred  of course  our name <eos>
<sos> was changed too  he added  pushing the socalled roll across  <eos>
<sos> the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded <eos>
<sos> stephen  whom he had singled out for attention in particular  squarely <eos>
<sos> by asking  <eos>
<sos>  and what might your name be  <eos>
<sos> just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion is boot but <eos>
<sos> stephen  apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected <eos>
<sos> quarter  answered  <eos>
<sos>  dedalus  <eos>
<sos> the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes  <eos>
<sos> rather bunged up from excessive use of boose  preferably good old <eos>
<sos> hollands and water  <eos>
<sos>  you know simon dedalus  he asked at length  <eos>
<sos>  i ve heard of him  stephen said  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom was all at sea for a moment  seeing the others evidently <eos>
<sos> eavesdropping too  <eos>
<sos>  he is irish  the seaman bold affirmed  staring still in much the same <eos>
<sos> way and nodding  all irish  <eos>
<sos>  all too irish  stephen rejoined  <eos>
<sos> as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole <eos>
<sos> business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when <eos>
<sos> the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the <eos>
<sos> shelter with the remark  <eos>
<sos>  i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his <eos>
<sos> shoulder  the lefthand dead shot  <eos>
<sos> though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his <eos>
<sos> gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain  <eos>
<sos>  bottles out there  say  fifty yards measured  eggs on the bottles  <eos>
<sos> cocks his gun over his shoulder  aims  <eos>
<sos> he turned his body half round  shut up his right eye completely  then <eos>
<sos> he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the <eos>
<sos> night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance  <eos>
<sos>  pom  he then shouted once  <eos>
<sos> the entire audience waited  anticipating an additional detonation  <eos>
<sos> there being still a further egg  <eos>
<sos>  pom  he shouted twice  <eos>
<sos> egg two evidently demolished  he nodded and winked  adding <eos>
<sos> bloodthirstily  <eos>
<sos> _ buffalo bill shoots to kill  <eos>
<sos> never missed nor he never will _ <eos>
<sos> a silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness  sake just felt like <eos>
<sos> asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the <eos>
<sos> bisley  <eos>
<sos>  beg pardon  the sailor said  <eos>
<sos>  long ago  mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth  <eos>
<sos>  why  the sailor replied  relaxing to a certain extent under the magic <eos>
<sos> influence of diamond cut diamond  it might be a matter of ten years  he <eos>
<sos> toured the wide world with hengler is royal circus  i seen him do that <eos>
<sos> in stockholm  <eos>
<sos>  curious coincidence  mr bloom confided to stephen unobtrusively  <eos>
<sos>  murphy is my name  the sailor continued  d  b  murphy of carrigaloe  <eos>
<sos> know where that is  <eos>
<sos>  queenstown harbour  stephen replied  <eos>
<sos>  that is right  the sailor said  fort camden and fort carlisle  that is <eos>
<sos> where i hails from  i belongs there  that is where i hails from  my <eos>
<sos> little woman is down there  she is waiting for me  i know  _for england  <eos>
<sos> home and beauty_  she is my own true wife i have not seen for seven years <eos>
<sos> now  sailing about  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene  the homecoming <eos>
<sos> to the mariner is roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones  a <eos>
<sos> rainy night with a blind moon  across the world for a wife  quite a <eos>
<sos> number of stories there were on that particular alice ben bolt topic  <eos>
<sos> enoch arden and rip van winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember <eos>
<sos> caoc o leary  a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way <eos>
<sos> of poor john casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way  <eos>
<sos> never about the runaway wife coming back  however much devoted to the <eos>
<sos> absentee  the face at the window  judge of his astonishment when he <eos>
<sos> finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent <eos>
<sos> his better half  wrecked in his affections  you little expected me but <eos>
<sos> i ve come to stay and make a fresh start  there she sits  a grasswidow  <eos>
<sos> at the selfsame fireside  believes me dead  rocked in the cradle of the <eos>
<sos> deep  and there sits uncle chubb or tomkin  as the case might be  the <eos>
<sos> publican of the crown and anchor  in shirtsleeves  eating rumpsteak and <eos>
<sos> onions  no chair for father  broo  the wind  her brandnew arrival is on <eos>
<sos> her knee  post mortem child  with a high ro  and a randy ro  and my <eos>
<sos> galloping tearing tandy  o  bow to the inevitable  grin and bear it  i <eos>
<sos> remain with much love your brokenhearted husband w  b  murphy  <eos>
<sos> the sailor  who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident  turned to one <eos>
<sos> of the jarvies with the request  <eos>
<sos>  you do not happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you  <eos>
<sos> the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die <eos>
<sos> of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object <eos>
<sos> was passed from hand to hand  <eos>
<sos>  thank you  the sailor said  <eos>
<sos> he deposited the quid in his gob and  chewing and with some slow <eos>
<sos> stammers  proceeded  <eos>
<sos>  we come up this morning eleven o clock  the threemaster rosevean <eos>
<sos> from bridgwater with bricks  i shipped to get over  paid off this <eos>
<sos> afternoon  there is my discharge  see  d  b  murphy  a  b  s  <eos>
<sos> in confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket <eos>
<sos> and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document  <eos>
<sos>  you must have seen a fair share of the world  the keeper remarked  <eos>
<sos> leaning on the counter  <eos>
<sos>  why  the sailor answered upon reflection upon it  i ve circumnavigated <eos>
<sos> a bit since i first joined on  i was in the red sea  i was in china and <eos>
<sos> north america and south america  we was chased by pirates one voyage  i <eos>

<sos> he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed <eos>
<sos> to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table  <eos>
<sos> the printed matter on it stated  choza de indios  beni  bolivia  <eos>

<sos> having boxed the compass on the strict q t  somewhere  and the <eos>
<sos> fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some <eos>
<sos> suspicions of our friend is bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in <eos>
<sos> a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some <eos>
<sos> wednesday or saturday of travelling to london via long sea not to say <eos>
<sos> that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was <eos>
<sos> at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had <eos>
<sos> consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to holyhead <eos>
<sos> which was his longest  martin cunningham frequently said he would work <eos>
<sos> a pass through egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up <eos>
<sos> with the net result that the scheme fell through  but even suppose it <eos>
<sos> did come to planking down the needful and breaking boyd is heart it was <eos>
<sos> not so dear  purse permitting  a few guineas at the outside considering <eos>
<sos> the fare to mullingar where he figured on going was five and six  there <eos>
<sos> and back  the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone <eos>
<sos> and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable  especially for a chap whose <eos>
<sos> liver was out of order  seeing the different places along the route  <eos>
<sos> plymouth  falmouth  southampton and so on culminating in an instructive <eos>

<sos> and moody manners  perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of <eos>
<sos> success  providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some <eos>
<sos> fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and <eos>
<sos> thus combine business with pleasure  but who  that was the rub  <eos>
<sos> also  without being actually positive  it struck him a great field was <eos>

<sos> was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public <eos>
<sos> at large  the average man  i e  brown  robinson and co  <eos>
<sos> it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no <eos>
<sos> small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street  when the <eos>
<sos> system really needed toning up  for the matter of a couple of paltry <eos>
<sos> pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead <eos>
<sos> of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick in the mud took <eos>

<sos> grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that <eos>
<sos> the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering <eos>

<sos> pillar  because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely <eos>
<sos> in its infancy  so to speak  and the accommodation left much to be <eos>
<sos> desired  interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of <eos>
<sos> curiosity  pure and simple  was whether it was the traffic that created <eos>
<sos> the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact  he turned back the <eos>
<sos> other side of the card  picture  and passed it along to stephen  <eos>
<sos>  i seen a chinese one time  related the doughty narrator  that had <eos>
<sos> little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened <eos>
<sos> and every pill was something different  one was a ship  another was a <eos>
<sos> house  another was a flower  cooks rats in your soup  he appetisingly <eos>
<sos> added  the chinks does  <eos>
<sos> possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the <eos>
<sos> globetrotter went on  adhering to his adventures  <eos>
<sos>  and i seen a man killed in trieste by an italian chap  knife in his <eos>
<sos> back  knife like that  <eos>
<sos> whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in <eos>
<sos> keeping with his character and held it in the striking position  <eos>
<sos>  in a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers  <eos>
<sos> fellow hid behind a door  come up behind him  like that  _prepare to <eos>
<sos> meet your god_  says he  chuk  it went into his back up to the butt  <eos>
<sos> his heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further <eos>
<sos> questions even should they by any chance want to  <eos>
<sos>  that is a good bit of steel  repeated he  examining his formidable <eos>
<sos> stiletto  <eos>
<sos> after which harrowing dénouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he <eos>
<sos> snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before <eos>
<sos> in his chamber of horrors  otherwise pocket  <eos>
<sos>  they re great for the cold steel  somebody who was evidently quite in <eos>
<sos> the dark said for the benefit of them all  that was why they thought <eos>
<sos> the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account <eos>
<sos> of them using knives  <eos>
<sos> at this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is <eos>
<sos> bliss_ mr b  and stephen  each in his own particular way  both <eos>
<sos> instinctively exchanged meaning glances  in a religious silence of the <eos>
<sos> strictly entre nous variety however  towards where skin the goat  <eos>
<sos> alias the keeper  not turning a hair  was drawing spurts of liquid <eos>
<sos> from his boiler affair  his inscrutable face which was really a work of <eos>
<sos> art  a perfect study in itself  beggaring description  conveyed the <eos>
<sos> impression that he did not understand one jot of what was going on  <eos>
<sos> funny  very  <eos>
<sos> there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause  one man was reading in fits and <eos>
<sos> starts a stained by coffee evening journal  another the card with the <eos>
<sos> natives choza de  another the seaman is discharge  mr bloom  so far as <eos>
<sos> he was personally concerned  was just pondering in pensive mood  he <eos>
<sos> vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well <eos>
<sos> as yesterday  roughly some score of years previously in the days of the <eos>
<sos> land troubles  when it took the civilised world by storm  figuratively <eos>
<sos> speaking  early in the eighties  eightyone to be correct  when he was <eos>
<sos> just turned fifteen  <eos>
<sos>  ay  boss  the sailor broke in  give us back them papers  <eos>
<sos> the request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape  <eos>
<sos>  have you seen the rock of gibraltar  mr bloom inquired  <eos>
<sos> the sailor grimaced  chewing  in a way that might be read as yes  ay or <eos>
<sos> no  <eos>
<sos>  ah  you ve touched there too  mr bloom said  europa point  thinking he <eos>
<sos> had  in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences <eos>
<sos> but he failed to do so  simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the <eos>
<sos> sawdust  and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn  <eos>
<sos>  what year would that be about  mr b interrogated  can you recall the <eos>
<sos> boats  <eos>
<sos> our soi disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before <eos>
<sos> answering  <eos>
<sos>  i am tired of all them rocks in the sea  he said  and boats and ships  <eos>
<sos> salt junk all the time  <eos>
<sos> tired seemingly  he ceased  his questioner perceiving that he was not <eos>
<sos> likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer  <eos>
<sos> fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the <eos>
<sos> globe  suffice it to say that  as a casual glance at the map revealed  <eos>
<sos> it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly <eos>
<sos> what it meant to rule the waves  on more than one occasion  a dozen at <eos>
<sos> the lowest  near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a <eos>
<sos> superannuated old salt  evidently derelict  seated habitually near the <eos>
<sos> not particularly redolent sea on the wall  staring quite obliviously at <eos>
<sos> it and it at him  dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone <eos>
<sos> somewhere sings  and it left him wondering why  possibly he had tried <eos>
<sos> to find out the secret for himself  floundering up and down the <eos>
<sos> antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under  well  not <eos>
<sos> exactly under  tempting the fates  and the odds were twenty to nil <eos>
<sos> there was really no secret about it at all  nevertheless  without going <eos>
<sos> into the minutiae of the business  the eloquent fact remained that <eos>
<sos> the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things <eos>
<sos> somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence <eos>
<sos> though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that <eos>
<sos> sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery <eos>
<sos> and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for <eos>
<sos> that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable <eos>
<sos> institution to which the public at large  no matter where living inland <eos>
<sos> or seaside  as the case might be  having it brought home to them like <eos>
<sos> that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and <eos>
<sos> coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid <eos>
<sos> the elements whatever the season when duty called _ireland expects that <eos>
<sos> every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the <eos>
<sos> wintertime not forgetting the irish lights  kish and others  liable to <eos>
<sos> capsize at any moment  rounding which he once with his daughter had <eos>
<sos> experienced some remarkably choppy  not to say stormy  weather  <eos>
<sos>  there was a fellow sailed with me in the rover  the old seadog  <eos>
<sos> himself a rover  proceeded  went ashore and took up a soft job as <eos>
<sos> gentleman is valet at six quid a month  them are his trousers i ve on me <eos>
<sos> and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife  i am game for that job  <eos>
<sos> shaving and brushup  i hate roaming about  there is my son now  danny  <eos>
<sos> run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper is in cork where <eos>
<sos> he could be drawing easy money  <eos>
<sos>  what age is he  queried one hearer who  by the way  seen from the <eos>
<sos> side  bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell  the townclerk  away <eos>
<sos> from the carking cares of office  unwashed of course and in a seedy <eos>
<sos> getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage  <eos>
<sos>  why  the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance  my son  danny  <eos>
<sos> he d be about eighteen now  way i figure it  <eos>
<sos> the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow <eos>
<sos> shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was <eos>
<sos> to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent <eos>
<sos> an anchor  <eos>
<sos>  there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater  he remarked  sure as nuts  <eos>
<sos> i must get a wash tomorrow or next day  it is them black lads i objects <eos>
<sos> to  i hate those buggers  suck your blood dry  they does  <eos>
<sos> seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged <eos>
<sos> his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the <eos>
<sos> mariner is hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a <eos>
<sos> young man is sideface looking frowningly rather  <eos>
<sos>  tattoo  the exhibitor explained  that was done when we were lying <eos>
<sos> becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton  fellow  the <eos>
<sos> name of antonio  done that  there he is himself  a greek  <eos>
<sos>  did it hurt much doing it  one asked the sailor  <eos>
<sos> that worthy  however  was busily engaged in collecting round the  <eos>
<sos> someway in his  squeezing or  <eos>
<sos>  see here  he said  showing antonio  there he is cursing the mate  and <eos>
<sos> there he is now  he added  the same fellow  pulling the skin with his <eos>
<sos> fingers  some special knack evidently  and he laughing at a yarn  <eos>
<sos> and in point of fact the young man named antonio is livid face did <eos>
<sos> actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the <eos>
<sos> unreserved admiration of everybody including skin the goat  who this <eos>
<sos> time stretched over  <eos>
<sos>  ay  ay  sighed the sailor  looking down on his manly chest  he is gone <eos>
<sos> too  ate by sharks after  ay  ay  <eos>
<sos> he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression <eos>
<sos> of before  <eos>
<sos>  neat bit of work  one longshoreman said  <eos>
<sos>  and what is the number for  loafer number two queried  <eos>
<sos>  eaten alive  a third asked the sailor  <eos>
<sos>  ay  ay  sighed again the latter personage  more cheerily this time <eos>
<sos> with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the <eos>
<sos> direction of the questioner about the number  ate  a greek he was  <eos>
<sos> and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his <eos>
<sos> alleged end  <eos>
<sos>  as bad as old antonio  <eos>
<sos> for he left me on my ownio  <eos>
<sos> the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat <eos>
<sos> peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on <eos>
<sos> her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill  mr bloom  <eos>
<sos> scarcely knowing which way to look  turned away on the moment <eos>
<sos> flusterfied but outwardly calm  and  picking up from the table the pink <eos>
<sos> sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey  if such he was  had <eos>
<sos> laid aside  he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though <eos>
<sos> why pink  his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round <eos>
<sos> the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that <eos>
<sos> afternoon on ormond quay  the partially idiotic female  namely  of the <eos>
<sos> lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you  mrs b   <eos>
<sos> and begged the chance of his washing  also why washing which seemed <eos>
<sos> rather vague than not  your washing  still candour compelled him to <eos>
<sos> admit he had washed his wife is undergarments when soiled in holles <eos>
<sos> street and women would and did too a man is similar garments initialled <eos>
<sos> with bewley and draper is marking ink  hers were  that is  if they <eos>
<sos> really loved him  that is to say  love me  love my dirty shirt  still <eos>
<sos> just then  being on tenterhooks  he desired the female is room more than <eos>
<sos> her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a <eos>
<sos> rude sign to take herself off  round the side of the _evening <eos>
<sos> telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side <eos>
<sos> of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was <eos>
<sos> not exactly all there  viewing with evident amusement the group of <eos>
<sos> gazers round skipper murphy is nautical chest and then there was no more <eos>
<sos> of her  <eos>
<sos>  the gunboat  the keeper said  <eos>
<sos>  it beats me  mr bloom confided to stephen  medically i am speaking  <eos>
<sos> how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with <eos>
<sos> disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober <eos>
<sos> senses  if he values his health in the least  unfortunate creature  of <eos>
<sos> course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition  <eos>
<sos> still no matter what the cause is from    <eos>
<sos> stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders  merely <eos>
<sos> remarking  <eos>
<sos>  in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a <eos>
<sos> roaring trade  fear not them that sell the body but have not power to <eos>
<sos> buy the soul  she is a bad merchant  she buys dear and sells cheap  <eos>
<sos> the elder man  though not by any manner of means an old maid or a <eos>
<sos> prude  said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be <eos>
<sos> put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp  quite apart <eos>
<sos> from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject   a necessary evil  <eos>
<sos> were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities  a <eos>
<sos> thing  he could truthfully state  he  as a paterfamilias  was a <eos>
<sos> stalwart advocate of from the very first start  whoever embarked on a <eos>
<sos> policy of the sort  he said  and ventilated the matter thoroughly would <eos>
<sos> confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned  <eos>
<sos>  you as a good catholic  he observed  talking of body and soul  believe <eos>
<sos> in the soul  or do you mean the intelligence  the brainpower as such  <eos>
<sos> as distinct from any outside object  the table  let us say  that cup  i <eos>
<sos> believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men <eos>
<sos> as the convolutions of the grey matter  otherwise we would never have <eos>
<sos> such inventions as x rays  for instance  do you  <eos>
<sos> thus cornered  stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try <eos>
<sos> and concentrate and remember before he could say  <eos>
<sos>  they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and <eos>
<sos> therefore incorruptible  it would be immortal  i understand  but for <eos>
<sos> the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who  from all i <eos>
<sos> can hear  is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other <eos>
<sos> practical jokes  corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both <eos>
<sos> being excluded by court etiquette  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the <eos>
<sos> mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he <eos>
<sos> felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple  promptly <eos>
<sos> rejoining  <eos>
<sos>  simple  i should not think that is the proper word  of course  i grant <eos>
<sos> you  to concede a point  you do knock across a simple soul once in a <eos>
<sos> blue moon  but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for <eos>
<sos> instance to invent those rays röntgen did or the telescope like edison  <eos>
<sos> though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man  i mean  <eos>
<sos> and the same applies to the laws  for example  of a farreaching natural <eos>
<sos> phenomenon such as electricity but it is a horse of quite another colour <eos>
<sos> to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god  <eos>
<sos>  o that  stephen expostulated  has been proved conclusively by several <eos>
<sos> of the bestknown passages in holy writ  apart from circumstantial <eos>
<sos> evidence  <eos>
<sos> on this knotty point however the views of the pair  poles apart as they <eos>
<sos> were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference <eos>
<sos> in their respective ages  clashed  <eos>
<sos>  has been  the more experienced of the two objected  sticking to his <eos>
<sos> original point with a smile of unbelief  i am not so sure about that  <eos>
<sos> that is a matter for everyman is opinion and  without dragging in the <eos>
<sos> sectarian side of the business  i beg to differ with you in toto <eos>
<sos> there  my belief is  to tell you the candid truth  that those bits were <eos>
<sos> genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it is the <eos>
<sos> big question of our national poet over again  who precisely wrote them <eos>
<sos> like hamlet and bacon  as  you who know your shakespeare infinitely <eos>
<sos> better than i  of course i need not tell you  ca not you drink that <eos>
<sos> coffee  by the way  let me stir it  and take a piece of that bun  it is <eos>
<sos> like one of our skipper is bricks disguised  still no one can give what <eos>
<sos> he has not got  try a bit  <eos>
<sos>  could not  stephen contrived to get out  his mental organs for the <eos>
<sos> moment refusing to dictate further  <eos>
<sos> faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir <eos>
<sos> or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with <eos>
<sos> something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance <eos>
<sos>  and lucrative  work  to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond <eos>
<sos> yea or nay did a world of good  shelters such as the present one they <eos>
<sos> were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night  concerts  dramatic <eos>
<sos> evenings and useful lectures  admittance free  by qualified men for the <eos>
<sos> lower orders  on the other hand he had a distinct and painful <eos>
<sos> recollection they paid his wife  madam marion tweedy who had been <eos>
<sos> prominently associated with it at one time  a very modest remuneration <eos>
<sos> indeed for her pianoplaying  the idea  he was strongly inclined to <eos>
<sos> believe  was to do good and net a profit  there being no competition to <eos>
<sos> speak of  sulphate of copper poison so4 or something in some dried peas <eos>
<sos> he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he <eos>
<sos> could not remember when it was or where  anyhow inspection  medical <eos>
<sos> inspection  of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary <eos>
<sos> which possibly accounted for the vogue of dr tibble is vi cocoa on <eos>
<sos> account of the medical analysis involved  <eos>
<sos>  have a shot at it now  he ventured to say of the coffee after being <eos>
<sos> stirred  <eos>
<sos> thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug <eos>
<sos> from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and <eos>
<sos> took a sip of the offending beverage  <eos>
<sos>  still it is solid food  his good genius urged  i am a stickler for solid <eos>
<sos> food  his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but <eos>
<sos> regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work  mental <eos>
<sos> or manual  you ought to eat more solid food  you would feel a different <eos>
<sos> man  <eos>
<sos>  liquids i can eat  stephen said  but o  oblige me by taking away that <eos>
<sos> knife  i ca not look at the point of it  it reminds me of roman history  <eos>
<sos> mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated <eos>
<sos> article  a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly <eos>
<sos> roman or antique about it to the lay eye  observing that the point was <eos>
<sos> the least conspicuous point about it  <eos>
<sos>  our mutual friend is stories are like himself  mr bloom apropos of <eos>
<sos> knives remarked to his confidante sotto voce  do you think they are <eos>
<sos> genuine  he could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and <eos>
<sos> lie like old boots  look at him  <eos>
<sos> yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was <eos>
<sos> full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it <eos>
<sos> was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire <eos>
<sos> fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent <eos>
<sos> probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly <eos>
<sos> accurate gospel  <eos>
<sos> he had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and <eos>
<sos> sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him  though a <eos>
<sos> wellpreserved man of no little stamina  if a trifle prone to baldness  <eos>
<sos> there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a <eos>
<sos> jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to <eos>
<sos> associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill <eos>
<sos> fraternity  he might even have done for his man supposing it was his <eos>
<sos> own case he told  as people often did about others  namely  that he <eos>
<sos> killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in <eos>
<sos> durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage  no relation to <eos>
<sos> the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our <eos>
<sos> national poet  who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above <eos>
<sos> described  on the other hand he might be only bluffing  a pardonable <eos>
<sos> weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs  dublin residents  like <eos>
<sos> those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner <eos>
<sos> who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner <eos>
<sos> hesperus and etcetera  and when all was said and done the lies a <eos>
<sos> fellow told about himself could not probably hold a proverbial candle to <eos>
<sos> the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him  <eos>
<sos>  mind you  i am not saying that it is all a pure invention  he resumed  <eos>
<sos> analogous scenes are occasionally  if not often  met with  giants  <eos>
<sos> though that is rather a far cry  you see once in a way  marcella the <eos>
<sos> midget queen  in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some <eos>
<sos> aztecs  as they are called  sitting bowlegged  they could not straighten <eos>
<sos> their legs if you paid them because the muscles here  you see  he <eos>
<sos> proceeded  indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews <eos>
<sos> or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee  were utterly <eos>
<sos> powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up  being adored as <eos>
<sos> gods  there is an example again of simple souls  <eos>
<sos> however reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures  who <eos>
<sos> reminded him a bit of ludwig  alias ledwidge  when he occupied the <eos>
<sos> boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the <eos>
<sos> management in the flying dutchman  a stupendous success  and his host <eos>
<sos> of admirers came in large numbers  everyone simply flocking to hear him <eos>
<sos> though ships of any sort  phantom or the reverse  on the stage usually <eos>
<sos> fell a bit flat as also did trains  there was nothing intrinsically <eos>
<sos> incompatible about it  he conceded  on the contrary that stab in the <eos>
<sos> back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he <eos>
<sos> was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the <eos>
<sos> fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in <eos>
<sos> little italy there near the coombe were sober thrifty hardworking <eos>
<sos> fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless <eos>
<sos> necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to <eos>
<sos> have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur off him or <eos>
<sos> her next day on the quiet and  he added  on the cheap  <eos>
<sos>  spaniards  for instance  he continued  passionate temperaments like <eos>
<sos> that  impetuous as old nick  are given to taking the law into their own <eos>
<sos> hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they <eos>
<sos> carry in the abdomen  it comes from the great heat  climate generally  <eos>
<sos> my wife is  so to speak  spanish  half that is  point of fact she could <eos>
<sos> actually claim spanish nationality if she wanted  having been born in <eos>
<sos>  technically  spain  i e  gibraltar  she has the spanish type  quite <eos>
<sos> dark  regular brunette  black  i for one certainly believe climate <eos>
<sos> accounts for character  that is why i asked you if you wrote your poetry <eos>
<sos> in italian  <eos>
<sos>  the temperaments at the door  stephen interposed with  were very <eos>
<sos> passionate about ten shillings  roberto ruba roba sua  <eos>
<sos>  quite so  mr bloom dittoed  <eos>
<sos>  then  stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown <eos>
<sos> listener somewhere  we have the impetuosity of dante and the isosceles <eos>
<sos> triangle miss portinari he fell in love with and leonardo and san <eos>
<sos> tommaso mastino  <eos>
<sos>  it is in the blood  mr bloom acceded at once  all are washed in the <eos>
<sos> blood of the sun  coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare <eos>
<sos> street museum today  shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call it  <eos>
<sos> and i was just looking at those antique statues there  the splendid <eos>
<sos> proportions of hips  bosom  you simply do not knock against those kind <eos>
<sos> of women here  an exception here and there  handsome yes  pretty in a <eos>
<sos> way you find but what i am talking about is the female form  besides <eos>
<sos> they have so little taste in dress  most of them  which greatly <eos>
<sos> enhances a woman is natural beauty  no matter what you say  rumpled <eos>
<sos> stockings  it may be  possibly is  a foible of mine but still it is a <eos>
<sos> thing i simply hate to see  <eos>
<sos> interest  however  was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the <eos>
<sos> others got on to talking about accidents at sea  ships lost in a fog  <eos>
<sos> collisions with icebergs  all that sort of thing  shipahoy of course <eos>
<sos> had his own say to say  he had doubled the cape a few odd times and <eos>
<sos> weathered a monsoon  a kind of wind  in the china seas and through all <eos>
<sos> those perils of the deep there was one thing  he declared  stood to him <eos>
<sos> or words to that effect  a pious medal he had that saved him  <eos>
<sos> so then after that they drifted on to the wreck off daunt is rock  wreck <eos>
<sos> of that illfated norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for <eos>
<sos> the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of henry <eos>
<sos> campbell remembered it palme on booterstown strand  that was the talk <eos>
<sos> of the town that year  albert william quill wrote a fine piece of <eos>
<sos> original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the irish <eos>
<sos> times   breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore <eos>
<sos> in commotion petrified with horror  then someone said something about <eos>
<sos> the case of the s  s  lady cairns of swansea run into by the mona <eos>
<sos> which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with <eos>
<sos> all hands on deck  no aid was given  her master  the mona s  said he <eos>
<sos> was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way  she had no water  it <eos>
<sos> appears  in her hold  <eos>
<sos> at this stage an incident happened  it having become necessary for him <eos>
<sos> to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat  <eos>
<sos>  let me cross your bows mate  he said to his neighbour who was just <eos>
<sos> gently dropping off into a peaceful doze  <eos>
<sos> he made tracks heavily  slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door  <eos>
<sos> stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore <eos>
<sos> due left  while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who <eos>
<sos> noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship is <eos>
<sos> rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his <eos>
<sos> burning interior  saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew <eos>
<sos> and  applying its nozzle to his lips  take a good old delectable swig <eos>
<sos> out of it with a gurgling noise  the irrepressible bloom  who also had <eos>
<sos> a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the <eos>
<sos> counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared <eos>
<sos> to all intents and purposes  could by straining just perceive him  when <eos>
<sos> duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit  gaping up at the piers and <eos>
<sos> girders of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was <eos>
<sos> all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved  some <eos>
<sos> person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by <eos>
<sos> the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a <eos>
<sos> brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor  <eos>
<sos> evidently giving it a wide berth  eased himself closer at hand  the <eos>
<sos> noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the <eos>
<sos> ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank  a hoof scooped <eos>
<sos> anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled  slightly <eos>
<sos> disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of <eos>
<sos> the corporation stones who  though now broken down and fast breaking <eos>
<sos> up  was none other in stern reality than the gumley aforesaid  now <eos>
<sos> practically on the parish rates  given the temporary job by pat tobin <eos>
<sos> in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before <eos>
<sos> shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again <eos>
<sos> in to the arms of morpheus  a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its <eos>
<sos> most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and <eos>
<sos> familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a <eos>
<sos> cool   100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass <eos>
<sos> proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of  and there he was at the <eos>
<sos> end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink <eos>
<sos> without a beggarly stiver  he drank needless to be told and it pointed <eos>
<sos> only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of <eos>
<sos> business if a big if  however he had contrived to cure himself of his <eos>
<sos> particular partiality  <eos>
<sos> all meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping  <eos>
<sos> coastwise and foreign as well  which was all part and parcel of the <eos>
<sos> same thing  a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra <eos>
<sos> basin  the only launch that year  right enough the harbours were there <eos>
<sos> only no ships ever called  <eos>
<sos> there were wrecks and wreckers  the keeper said  who was evidently _au <eos>
<sos> fait_  <eos>
<sos> what he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only <eos>
<sos> rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr <eos>
<sos> worthington or some name like that  eh  ask the then captain  he <eos>
<sos> advised them  how much palmoil the british government gave him for that <eos>
<sos> day is work  captain john lever of the lever line  <eos>
<sos>  am i right  skipper  he queried of the sailor  now returning after his <eos>
<sos> private potation and the rest of his exertions  <eos>
<sos> that worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words <eos>
<sos> growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or <eos>
<sos> other in seconds or thirds  mr bloom is sharp ears heard him then <eos>
<sos> expectorate the plug probably  which it was   so that he must have <eos>
<sos> lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and <eos>
<sos> making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in <eos>
<sos> question  anyhow in he rolled after his successful <eos>
<sos> libation cum potation  introducing an atmosphere of drink into the <eos>
<sos> soirée  boisterously trolling  like a veritable son of a seacook  <eos>
<sos>  the biscuits was as hard as brass <eos>
<sos> and the beef as salt as lot is wife is arse  <eos>
<sos> o  johnny lever  <eos>
<sos> johnny lever  o  <eos>
<sos> after which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene <eos>
<sos> and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form <eos>
<sos> provided  skin the goat  assuming he was he  evidently with an axe to <eos>
<sos> grind  was airing his grievances in a forcible feeble philippic anent <eos>
<sos> the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he <eos>
<sos> described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none <eos>
<sos> on the face of god is earth  far and away superior to england  with coal <eos>
<sos> in large quantities  six million pounds worth of pork exported every <eos>
<sos> year  ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained <eos>
<sos> out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through <eos>
<sos> the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot <eos>
<sos> more surplus steam in the same vein  their conversation accordingly <eos>
<sos> became general and all agreed that that was a fact  you could grow any <eos>
<sos> mortal thing in irish soil  he stated  and there was that colonel <eos>
<sos> everard down there in navan growing tobacco  where would you find <eos>
<sos> anywhere the like of irish bacon  but a day of reckoning  he stated <eos>
<sos> crescendo with no uncertain voice  thoroughly monopolising all the <eos>
<sos> conversation  was in store for mighty england  despite her power of <eos>
<sos> pelf on account of her crimes  there would be a fall and the greatest <eos>
<sos> fall in history  the germans and the japs were going to have their <eos>
<sos> little lookin  he affirmed  the boers were the beginning of the end  <eos>
<sos> brummagem england was toppling already and her downfall would be <eos>
<sos> ireland  her achilles heel  which he explained to them about the <eos>
<sos> vulnerable point of achilles  the greek hero  a point his auditors at <eos>
<sos> once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the <eos>
<sos> tendon referred to on his boot  his advice to every irishman was  stay <eos>
<sos> in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland  <eos>
<sos> ireland  parnell said  could not spare a single one of her sons  <eos>
<sos> silence all round marked the termination of his finale  the <eos>
<sos> impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings  undismayed  <eos>
<sos>  take a bit of doing  boss  retaliated that rough diamond palpably a <eos>
<sos> bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism  <eos>
<sos> to which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper <eos>
<sos> concurred but nevertheless held to his main view  <eos>
<sos>  who is the best troops in the army  the grizzled old veteran irately <eos>
<sos> interrogated  and the best jumpers and racers  and the best admirals <eos>
<sos> and generals we ve got  tell me that  <eos>
<sos>  the irish  for choice  retorted the cabby like campbell  facial <eos>
<sos> blemishes apart  <eos>
<sos>  that is right  the old tarpaulin corroborated  the irish catholic <eos>
<sos> peasant  he is the backbone of our empire  you know jem mullins  <eos>
<sos> while allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added <eos>
<sos> he cared nothing for any empire  ours or his  and considered no <eos>
<sos> irishman worthy of his salt that served it  then they began to have a <eos>
<sos> few irascible words when it waxed hotter  both  needless to say  <eos>
<sos> appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with <eos>
<sos> interest so long as they did not indulge in recriminations and come to <eos>
<sos> blows  <eos>
<sos> from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was <eos>
<sos> rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for  <eos>
<sos> pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for  he <eos>
<sos> was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the <eos>
<sos> channel  unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for  <eos>
<sos> rather concealed their strength than the opposite  it was quite on a <eos>
<sos> par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred <eos>
<sos> million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out <eos>
<sos> and if  as time went on  that turned out to be how the cat jumped all <eos>
<sos> he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of <eos>
<sos> contingencies  equally relevant to the issue  might occur ere then it <eos>
<sos> was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both <eos>
<sos> countries even though poles apart  another little interesting point  <eos>
<sos> the amours of whores and chummies  to put it in common parlance  <eos>
<sos> reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against <eos>
<sos> her  more so  in fact  and now  why  so the scene between the pair of <eos>
<sos> them  the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris  <eos>
<sos> the famous invincible  and the other  obviously bogus  reminded him <eos>
<sos> forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick  supposing  <eos>
<sos> that is  it was prearranged as the lookeron  a student of the human <eos>
<sos> soul if anything  the others seeing least of the game  and as for the <eos>
<sos> lessee or keeper  who probably was not the other person at all  he  b   <eos>
<sos> could not help feeling and most properly it was better to give people <eos>
<sos> like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and <eos>
<sos> refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private <eos>
<sos> life and their felonsetting  there always being the offchance of a <eos>
<sos> dannyman coming forward and turning queen is evidence or king is now like <eos>
<sos> denis or peter carey  an idea he utterly repudiated  quite apart from <eos>
<sos> that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle  <eos>
<sos> yet  though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his <eos>
<sos> bosom in any shape or form  he certainly did feel and no denying it <eos>
<sos>  while inwardly remaining what he was  a certain kind of admiration for <eos>
<sos> a man who had actually brandished a knife  cold steel  with the courage <eos>
<sos> of his political convictions  though  personally  he would never be a <eos>
<sos> party to any such thing   off the same bat as those love vendettas of <eos>
<sos> the south  have her or swing for her  when the husband frequently  <eos>
<sos> after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with <eos>
<sos> the other lucky mortal  he having had the pair watched   inflicted <eos>
<sos> fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative <eos>
<sos> postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her  until it just <eos>
<sos> struck him that fitz  nicknamed skin the goat  merely drove the car for <eos>
<sos> the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not  if he was <eos>
<sos> reliably informed  actually party to the ambush which  in point of <eos>
<sos> fact  was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on  in any case <eos>
<sos> that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend  the pseudo <eos>
<sos> skin the etcetera  he had transparently outlived his welcome  he ought <eos>
<sos> to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high  like actresses  <eos>
<sos> always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again  <eos>
<sos> generous to a fault of course  temperamental  no economising or any <eos>
<sos> idea of the sort  always snapping at the bone for the shadow  so <eos>
<sos> similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid <eos>
<sos> of some    s  d  in the course of his perambulations round the docks in <eos>
<sos> the congenial atmosphere of the old ireland tavern  come back to erin <eos>
<sos> and so on  then as for the other he had heard not so long before the <eos>
<sos> same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually <eos>
<sos> silenced the offender  <eos>
<sos>  he took umbrage at something or other  that muchinjured but on the <eos>
<sos> whole eventempered person declared  i let slip  he called me a jew and <eos>
<sos> in a heated fashion offensively  so i without deviating from plain <eos>
<sos> facts in the least told him his god  i mean christ  was a jew too and <eos>
<sos> all his family like me though in reality i am not  that was one for him  <eos>
<sos> a soft answer turns away wrath  he had not a word to say for himself as <eos>
<sos> everyone saw  am i not right  <eos>
<sos> he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride <eos>
<sos> at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to <eos>
<sos> glean in a kind of a way that it was not all exactly  <eos>
<sos>  ex quibus  stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent  their two or <eos>
<sos> four eyes conversing  christus or bloom his name is or after all any <eos>
<sos> other  secundum carnem  <eos>
<sos>  of course  mr b  proceeded to stipulate  you must look at both sides <eos>
<sos> of the question  it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to <eos>
<sos> right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is <eos>
<sos> though every country  they say  our own distressful included  has the <eos>
<sos> government it deserves  but with a little goodwill all round  it is all <eos>
<sos> very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual <eos>
<sos> equality  i resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form  it <eos>
<sos> never reaches anything or stops anything  a revolution must come on the <eos>
<sos> due instalments plan  it is a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate <eos>
<sos> people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular  <eos>
<sos> in the next house so to speak  <eos>
<sos>  memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes  war  stephen <eos>
<sos> assented  between skinner is alley and ormond market  <eos>
<sos> yes  mr bloom thoroughly agreed  entirely endorsing the remark  that <eos>
<sos> was overwhelmingly right  and the whole world was full of that sort of <eos>
<sos> thing  <eos>
<sos>  you just took the words out of my mouth  he said  a hocuspocus of <eos>
<sos> conflicting evidence that candidly you could not remotely    <eos>
<sos> all those wretched quarrels  in his humble opinion  stirring up bad <eos>
<sos> blood  from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind  <eos>
<sos> erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag  were <eos>
<sos> very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of <eos>
<sos> everything  greed and jealousy  people never knowing when to stop  <eos>
<sos>  they accuse  remarked he audibly  he turned away from the others  who <eos>
<sos> probably  and spoke nearer to  so as the others  in case they  <eos>
<sos>  jews  he softly imparted in an aside in stephen is ear  are accused of <eos>
<sos> ruining  not a vestige of truth in it  i can safely say  history  would <eos>
<sos> you be surprised to learn  proves up to the hilt spain decayed when the <eos>
<sos> inquisition hounded the jews out and england prospered when cromwell  <eos>
<sos> an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer <eos>
<sos> for  imported them  why  because they are imbued with the proper <eos>
<sos> spirit  they are practical and are proved to be so  i do not want to <eos>
<sos> indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and <eos>
<sos> then orthodox as you are  but in the economic  not touching religion  <eos>
<sos> domain the priest spells poverty  spain again  you saw in the war  <eos>
<sos> compared with goahead america  turks  it is in the dogma  because if <eos>
<sos> they did not believe they d go straight to heaven when they die they d <eos>
<sos> try to live better  at least so i think  that is the juggle on which the <eos>
<sos> p p  s raise the wind on false pretences  i am  he resumed with dramatic <eos>
<sos> force  as good an irishman as that rude person i told you about at the <eos>
<sos> outset and i want to see everyone  concluded he  all creeds and classes <eos>
<sos> pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income  in no niggard fashion <eos>
<sos> either  something in the neighbourhood of   300 per annum  that is the <eos>
<sos> vital issue at stake and it is feasible and would be provocative of <eos>
<sos> friendlier intercourse between man and man  at least that is my idea for <eos>
<sos> what it is worth  i call that patriotism  ubi patria  as we learned a <eos>
<sos> smattering of in our classical days in alma mater  vita bene  where <eos>
<sos> you can live well  the sense is  if you work  <eos>
<sos> over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee  listening to this <eos>
<sos> synopsis of things in general  stephen stared at nothing in particular  <eos>
<sos> he could hear  of course  all kinds of words changing colour like those <eos>
<sos> crabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours <eos>
<sos> of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere <eos>
<sos> beneath or seemed to  then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or <eos>
<sos> did not say the words the voice he heard said  if you work  <eos>
<sos>  count me out  he managed to remark  meaning work  <eos>
<sos> the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he  the person <eos>
<sos> who owned them pro tem  observed or rather his voice speaking did  all <eos>
<sos> must work  have to  together  <eos>
<sos>  i mean  of course  the other hastened to affirm  work in the widest <eos>
<sos> possible sense  also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the <eos>
<sos> thing  writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel <eos>
<sos> nowadays  that is work too  important work  after all  from the little i <eos>
<sos> know of you  after all the money expended on your education you are <eos>
<sos> entitled to recoup yourself and command your price  you have every bit <eos>
<sos> as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the <eos>
<sos> peasant has  what  you both belong to ireland  the brain and the brawn  <eos>
<sos> each is equally important  <eos>
<sos>  you suspect  stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh  that i may <eos>
<sos> be important because i belong to the faubourg saint patrice called <eos>
<sos> ireland for short  <eos>
<sos>  i would go a step farther  mr bloom insinuated  <eos>
<sos>  but i suspect  stephen interrupted  that ireland must be important <eos>
<sos> because it belongs to me  <eos>
<sos>  what belongs  queried mr bloom bending  fancying he was perhaps under <eos>
<sos> some misapprehension  excuse me  unfortunately  i did not catch the <eos>
<sos> latter portion  what was it you     <eos>
<sos> stephen  patently crosstempered  repeated and shoved aside his mug of <eos>
<sos> coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely  adding  <eos>
<sos>  we ca not change the country  let us change the subject  <eos>
<sos> at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom  to change the subject  looked <eos>
<sos> down but in a quandary  as he could not tell exactly what construction <eos>
<sos> to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry  the rebuke of some <eos>
<sos> kind was clearer than the other part  needless to say the fumes of his <eos>
<sos> recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way <eos>
<sos> foreign to his sober state  probably the homelife to which mr b <eos>
<sos> attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he <eos>
<sos> had not been familiarised with the right sort of people  with a touch of <eos>
<sos> fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an <eos>
<sos> air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from paris  <eos>
<sos> the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister  <eos>
<sos> failing to throw much light on the subject  however  he brought to mind <eos>
<sos> instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in <eos>
<sos> the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves  for <eos>
<sos> instance there was the case of o callaghan  for one  the halfcrazy <eos>
<sos> faddist  respectably connected though of inadequate means  with his mad <eos>
<sos> vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a <eos>
<sos> nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously <eos>
<sos> sporting in public a suit of brown paper  a fact   and then the usual <eos>
<sos> dénouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed <eos>
<sos> into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends  after a <eos>
<sos> strong hint to a blind horse from john mallon of lower castle yard  so <eos>
<sos> as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law <eos>
<sos> amendment act  certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not <eos>
<sos> divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains  <eos>
<sos> briefly  putting two and two together  six sixteen which he pointedly <eos>
<sos> turned a deaf ear to  antonio and so forth  jockeys and esthetes and <eos>
<sos> the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in <eos>
<sos> the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne  <eos>
<sos> then heir apparent  the other members of the upper ten and other high <eos>
<sos> personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state  <eos>
<sos> he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running <eos>
<sos> counter to morality such as the cornwall case a number of years before <eos>

<sos> senses  dead he was not  simply absconded somewhere  the coffin they <eos>
<sos> brought over was full of stones  he changed his name to de wet  the <eos>
<sos> boer general  he made a mistake to fight the priests  and so forth and <eos>

<sos> all the same bloom  properly so dubbed  was rather surprised at their <eos>
<sos> memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and <eos>
<sos> not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it <eos>
<sos> was twenty odd years  highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow <eos>
<sos> of truth in the stones and  even supposing  he thought a return highly <eos>
<sos> inadvisable  all things considered  something evidently riled them in <eos>
<sos> his death  either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just <eos>
<sos> when his various different political arrangements were nearing <eos>
<sos> completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having <eos>
<sos> neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold <eos>
<sos> resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his <eos>
<sos> room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a <eos>
<sos> fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find <eos>
<sos> the job was taken out of their hands  of course nobody being acquainted <eos>
<sos> with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his <eos>
<sos> whereabouts which were decidedly of the alice  where art thou order <eos>
<sos> even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as fox and <eos>
<sos> stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within <eos>
<sos> the bounds of possibility  naturally then it would prey on his mind as <eos>
<sos> a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure  <eos>
<sos> a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged <eos>
<sos> feet  whereas messrs so and so who  though they were not even a patch on <eos>
<sos> the former man  ruled the roost after their redeeming features were <eos>
<sos> very few and far between  it certainly pointed a moral  the idol with <eos>
<sos> feet of clay  and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on <eos>
<sos> him with mutual mudslinging  and the identical same with murderers  you <eos>
<sos> had to come back  that haunting sense kind of drew you  to show the <eos>
<sos> understudy in the title rôle how to  he saw him once on the <eos>
<sos> auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the insuppressible <eos>
<sos> or was it united ireland  a privilege he keenly appreciated  and  in <eos>
<sos> point of fact  handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he <eos>
<sos> said thank you  excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid <eos>
<sos> exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the <eos>
<sos> cup and the lip  what is bred in the bone  still as regards return  you <eos>
<sos> were a lucky dog if they did not set the terrier at you directly you got <eos>
<sos> back  then a lot of shillyshally usually followed  tom for and dick and <eos>
<sos> harry against  and then  number one  you came up against the man in <eos>
<sos> possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the <eos>
<sos> tichborne case  roger charles tichborne  bella was the boat is name to <eos>
<sos> the best of his recollection he  the heir  went down in as the evidence <eos>
<sos> went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in indian ink  lord bellew <eos>
<sos> was it  as he might very easily have picked up the details from some <eos>
<sos> pal on board ship and then  when got up to tally with the description <eos>
<sos> given  introduce himself with  excuse me  my name is so and so or <eos>
<sos> some such commonplace remark  a more prudent course  as bloom said to <eos>
<sos> the not over effusive  in fact like the distinguished personage under <eos>
<sos> discussion beside him  would have been to sound the lie of the land <eos>
<sos> first  <eos>
<sos>  that bitch  that english whore  did for him  the shebeen proprietor <eos>
<sos> commented  she put the first nail in his coffin  <eos>
<sos>  fine lump of a woman all the same  the soi disant townclerk henry <eos>
<sos> campbell remarked  and plenty of her  she loosened many a man is thighs  <eos>
<sos> i seen her picture in a barber is  the husband was a captain or an <eos>
<sos> officer  <eos>
<sos>  ay  skin the goat amusingly added  he was and a cottonball one  <eos>
<sos> this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair <eos>
<sos> amount of laughter among his entourage  as regards bloom he  without <eos>
<sos> the faintest suspicion of a smile  merely gazed in the direction of the <eos>
<sos> door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused <eos>
<sos> extraordinary interest at the time when the facts  to make matters <eos>
<sos> worse  were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed <eos>
<sos> between them full of sweet nothings  first it was strictly platonic <eos>
<sos> till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till <eos>
<sos> bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of <eos>
<sos> the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not <eos>
<sos> a few evildisposed  however  who were resolved upon encompassing his <eos>
<sos> downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to <eos>
<sos> anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed <eos>
<sos> into  since their names were coupled  though  since he was her declared <eos>
<sos> favourite  where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the <eos>
<sos> rank and file from the housetops  the fact  namely  that he had shared <eos>
<sos> her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went <eos>
<sos> through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape <eos>
<sos> of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a <eos>
<sos> particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment <eos>
<sos> with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel  having gained <eos>
<sos> admittance in the same fashion  a fact the weeklies  addicted to the <eos>
<sos> lubric a little  simply coined shoals of money out of  whereas the <eos>
<sos> simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not <eos>
<sos> being up to the scratch  with nothing in common between them beyond the <eos>
<sos> name  and then a real man arriving on the scene  strong to the verge of <eos>
<sos> weakness  falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home <eos>
<sos> ties  the usual sequel  to bask in the loved one is smiles  the eternal <eos>
<sos> question of the life connubial  needless to say  cropped up  can real <eos>
<sos> love  supposing there happens to be another chap in the case  exist <eos>
<sos> between married folk  poser  though it was no concern of theirs <eos>
<sos> absolutely if he regarded her with affection  carried away by a wave of <eos>
<sos> folly  a magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented <eos>
<sos> obviously by gifts of a high order  as compared with the other military <eos>
<sos> supernumerary that is  who was just the usual everyday _farewell  my <eos>
<sos> gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons  the 18th <eos>
<sos> hussars to be accurate  and inflammable doubtless  the fallen leader  <eos>
<sos> that is  not the other  in his own peculiar way which she of course  <eos>
<sos> woman  quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame <eos>
<sos> which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the <eos>
<sos> gospel as a whole  his erstwhile staunch adherents  and his beloved <eos>
<sos> evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts <eos>
<sos> of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that <eos>
<sos> exceeded their most sanguine expectations  very effectually cooked his <eos>
<sos> matrimonial goose  thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in <eos>
<sos> the same way as the fabled ass is kick  looking back now in a <eos>
<sos> retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream  and then <eos>
<sos> coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without <eos>
<sos> saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the <eos>
<sos> times  why  as he reflected  irishtown strand  a locality he had not <eos>
<sos> been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since  as <eos>
<sos> it happened  he went to reside on the north side  north or south  <eos>
<sos> however  it was just the wellknown case of hot passion  pure and <eos>
<sos> simple  upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the <eos>
<sos> very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so  types that <eos>
<sos> would not do things by halves  passionate abandon of the south  casting <eos>
<sos> every shred of decency to the winds  <eos>
<sos>  just bears out what i was saying  he  with glowing bosom said to <eos>
<sos> stephen  about blood and the sun  and  if i do not greatly mistake she <eos>
<sos> was spanish too  <eos>
<sos>  the king of spain is daughter  stephen answered  adding something or <eos>
<sos> other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you spanish onions and <eos>
<sos> the first land called the deadman and from ramhead to scilly was so and <eos>
<sos> so many  <eos>
<sos>  was she  bloom ejaculated  surprised though not astonished by any <eos>
<sos> means  i never heard that rumour before  possible  especially there  it <eos>
<sos> was as she lived there  so  spain  <eos>
<sos> carefully avoiding a book in his pocket sweets of  which reminded him <eos>
<sos> by the by of that capel street library book out of date  he took out <eos>
<sos> his pocketbook and  turning over the various contents it contained <eos>
<sos> rapidly finally he  <eos>
<sos>  do you consider  by the by  he said  thoughtfully selecting a faded <eos>
<sos> photo which he laid on the table  that a spanish type  <eos>
<sos> stephen  obviously addressed  looked down on the photo showing a large <eos>
<sos> sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she <eos>
<sos> was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously <eos>
<sos> low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom  with more than <eos>
<sos> vision of breasts  her full lips parted and some perfect teeth  <eos>
<sos> standing near  ostensibly with gravity  a piano on the rest of which <eos>
<sos> was in old madrid  a ballad  pretty in its way  which was then all <eos>

<sos> her then  <eos>
<sos> beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his <eos>
<sos> legal wife who  he intimated  was the accomplished daughter of major <eos>
<sos> brian tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a <eos>
<sos> singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered <eos>
<sos> barely sweet sixteen  as for the face it was a speaking likeness in <eos>
<sos> expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a <eos>
<sos> lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage <eos>
<sos> in that getup  she could without difficulty  he said  have posed for <eos>
<sos> the ensemble  not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the  he dwelt  <eos>
<sos> being a bit of an artist in his spare time  on the female form in <eos>
<sos> general developmentally because  as it so happened  no later than that <eos>
<sos> afternoon he had seen those grecian statues  perfectly developed as <eos>

<sos> good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to <eos>
<sos> speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the <eos>
<sos> beauty for himself  her stage presence being  frankly  a treat in <eos>
<sos> itself which the camera could not at all do justice to  but it was <eos>
<sos> scarcely professional etiquette so  though it was a warm pleasant sort <eos>
<sos> of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering  for <eos>
<sos> sunshine after storm  and he did feel a kind of need there and then to <eos>
<sos> follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by <eos>

<sos> an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled  good as new  <eos>
<sos> much better in fact with the starch out  suppose she was gone when he  <eos>
<sos> i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely <eos>

<sos> was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter  and why not  an <eos>
<sos> awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a <eos>
<sos> lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same <eos>
<sos> old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or <eos>
<sos> the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about <eos>
<sos> the whole business  how they were fated to meet and an attachment <eos>
<sos> sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the <eos>
<sos> public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy <eos>
<sos> and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they <eos>

<sos> scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile <eos>
<sos> tribune is private morals  though palpably a radically altered man he <eos>
<sos> was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with <eos>
<sos> that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the <eos>
<sos> shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that <eos>
<sos> their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which <eos>
<sos> she  however  was the first to perceive  as those were particularly hot <eos>
<sos> times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a minor injury from a <eos>
<sos> nasty prod of some chap is elbow in the crowd that of course congregated <eos>
<sos> lodging some place about the pit of the stomach  fortunately not of a <eos>
<sos> grave character  his hat  parnell is  a silk one was inadvertently <eos>
<sos> knocked off and  as a matter of strict history  bloom was the man who <eos>
<sos> picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to <eos>
<sos> return it to him  and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity  <eos>
<sos> who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat <eos>
<sos> at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the <eos>
<sos> country he  as a matter of fact  having gone into it more for the kudos <eos>
<sos> of the thing than anything else  what is bred in the bone instilled into <eos>
<sos> him in infancy at his mother is knee in the shape of knowing what good <eos>
<sos> form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and <eos>
<sos> thanked him with perfect aplomb  saying  thank you  sir  though in <eos>
<sos> a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal <eos>
<sos> profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the <eos>
<sos> course of the day  history repeating itself with a difference  after <eos>
<sos> the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory <eos>
<sos> after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave  <eos>
<sos> on the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes <eos>
<sos> of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest  laughing <eos>
<sos> immoderately  pretending to understand everything  the why and the <eos>
<sos> wherefore  and in reality not knowing their own minds  it being a case <eos>
<sos> for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate <eos>
<sos> husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter <eos>
<sos> from the usual boy jones  who happened to come across them at the <eos>
<sos> crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another is arms  <eos>
<sos> drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a <eos>
<sos> domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord <eos>
<sos> and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not <eos>
<sos> receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would <eos>
<sos> overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes <eos>
<sos> though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as <eos>
<sos> quite possibly there were several others  he personally  being of a <eos>
<sos> sceptical bias  believed and did not make the smallest bones about <eos>
<sos> saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging <eos>
<sos> around on the waiting list about a lady  even supposing she was the <eos>
<sos> best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the <eos>
<sos> sake of argument  when  neglecting her duties  she chose to be tired of <eos>
<sos> wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to <eos>
<sos> press their attentions on her with improper intent  the upshot being <eos>
<sos> that her affections centred on another  the cause of many liaisons <eos>
<sos> between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty <eos>
<sos> and younger men  no doubt as several famous cases of feminine <eos>
<sos> infatuation proved up to the hilt  <eos>
<sos> it was a thousand pities a young fellow  blessed with an allowance of <eos>
<sos> brains as his neighbour obviously was  should waste his valuable time <eos>
<sos> with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last <eos>
<sos> him his lifetime  in the nature of single blessedness he would one day <eos>
<sos> take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the <eos>
<sos> interim ladies  society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the <eos>
<sos> gravest possible doubts  not that he wanted in the smallest to pump <eos>
<sos> stephen about miss ferguson  who was very possibly the particular <eos>
<sos> lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning   as <eos>
<sos> to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl <eos>
<sos> courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to <eos>
<sos> their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of <eos>
<sos> complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers  ways and <eos>
<sos> flowers and chocs  to think of him house and homeless  rooked by some <eos>
<sos> landlady worse than any stepmother  was really too bad at his age  the <eos>
<sos> queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who <eos>
<sos> was several years the other is senior or like his father but something <eos>
<sos> substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made <eos>
<sos> on unadulterated maternal nutriment or  failing that  the homely humpty <eos>
<sos> dumpty boiled  <eos>
<sos>  at what o clock did you dine  he questioned of the slim form and tired <eos>
<sos> though unwrinkled face  <eos>
<sos>  some time yesterday  stephen said  <eos>
<sos>  yesterday  exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow <eos>
<sos> friday  ah  you mean it is after twelve  <eos>
<sos>  the day before yesterday  stephen said  improving on himself  <eos>
<sos> literally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected  <eos>
<sos> though they did not see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there <eos>
<sos> somehow was as if both their minds were travelling  so to speak  in the <eos>
<sos> one train of thought  at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some <eos>
<sos> score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to <eos>
<sos> parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in <eos>
<sos> retrospect  which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself  he had a <eos>
<sos> sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas  for instance when the <eos>
<sos> evicted tenants question  then at its first inception  bulked largely <eos>
<sos> in people is mind though  it goes without saying  not contributing a <eos>
<sos> copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums  some of which <eos>
<sos> would not exactly hold water  he at the outset in principle at all <eos>
<sos> events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the <eos>
<sos> trend of modern opinion  a partiality  however  which  realising his <eos>
<sos> mistake  he was subsequently partially cured of  and even was twitted <eos>
<sos> with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he <eos>
<sos> at one time inculcated as a backtothelander  which was one reason he <eos>
<sos> strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion <eos>
<sos> by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernan is so that <eos>
<sos> he  though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of <eos>
<sos> mortals  be it repeated  departed from his customary habit to give him <eos>
<sos>  metaphorically  one in the gizzard though  so far as politics <eos>
<sos> themselves were concerned  he was only too conscious of the casualties <eos>
<sos> invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity <eos>
<sos> and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on <eos>
<sos> fine young fellows  chiefly  destruction of the fittest  in a word  <eos>
<sos> anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons  getting on for one  as it <eos>
<sos> was  it was high time to be retiring for the night  the crux was it was <eos>
<sos> a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue <eos>
<sos>  somebody having a temper of her own sometimes  and spoil the hash <eos>
<sos> altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog  breed <eos>
<sos> unknown  with a lame paw  not that the cases were either identical or <eos>
<sos> the reverse though he had hurt his hand too  to ontario terrace as he <eos>
<sos> very distinctly remembered  having been there  so to speak  on the <eos>
<sos> other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount <eos>
<sos> or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which <eos>
<sos> of the two alternatives  everything pointed to the fact that it behoved <eos>
<sos> him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity  all things <eos>
<sos> considered  his initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or <eos>
<sos> not over effusive but it grew on him someway  for one thing he might not <eos>
<sos> what you call jump at the idea  if approached  and what mostly worried <eos>
<sos> him was he did not know how to lead up to it or word it exactly  <eos>
<sos> supposing he did entertain the proposal  as it would afford him very <eos>
<sos> great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in <eos>
<sos> his way or some wardrobe  if found suitable  at all events he wound up <eos>
<sos> by concluding  eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent  a cup of <eos>
<sos> epps is cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two <eos>
<sos> and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands <eos>
<sos> and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast <eos>
<sos> amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort <eos>
<sos> was kicked up  a move had to be made because that merry old soul  the <eos>
<sos> grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot  did not <eos>
<sos> appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly <eos>
<sos> beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger is bawdyhouse <eos>
<sos> of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would <eos>
<sos> be the best clue to that equivocal character is whereabouts for a few <eos>
<sos> days to come  alternately racking their feelings  the mermaids   with <eos>
<sos> sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to <eos>
<sos> freeze the marrow of anybody is bones and mauling their largesized <eos>
<sos> charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment <eos>
<sos> of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for <eos>
<sos> as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address  as <eos>
<sos> mr algebra remarks passim  at the same time he inwardly chuckled over <eos>
<sos> his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being <eos>
<sos> a jew  people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what <eos>
<sos> properly riled them was a bite from a sheep  the most vulnerable point <eos>
<sos> too of tender achilles  your god was a jew  because mostly they <eos>
<sos> appeared to imagine he came from carrick on shannon or somewhereabouts <eos>
<sos> in the county sligo  <eos>
<sos>  i propose  our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while <eos>
<sos> prudently pocketing her photo  as it is rather stuffy here you just come <eos>
<sos> home with me and talk things over  my diggings are quite close in the <eos>
<sos> vicinity  you ca not drink that stuff  do you like cocoa  wait  i ll <eos>
<sos> just pay this lot  <eos>
<sos> the best plan clearly being to clear out  the remainder being plain <eos>
<sos> sailing  he beckoned  while prudently pocketing the photo  to the <eos>
<sos> keeper of the shanty who did not seem to  <eos>
<sos>  yes  that is the best  he assured stephen to whom for the matter of <eos>
<sos> that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less  <eos>
<sos> all kinds of utopian plans were flashing through his  b is  busy brain  <eos>
<sos> education  the genuine article   literature  journalism  prize titbits  <eos>

<sos> with hydros and seaside theatres  turning money away  duets in italian <eos>
<sos> with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other <eos>
<sos> things  no necessity  of course  to tell the world and his wife from <eos>
<sos> the housetops about it  and a slice of luck  an opening was all was <eos>
<sos> wanted  because he more than suspected he had his father is voice to <eos>
<sos> bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be <eos>
<sos> just as well  by the way no harm  to trail the conversation in the <eos>
<sos> direction of that particular red herring just to  <eos>
<sos> the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former <eos>
<sos> viceroy  earl cadogan  had presided at the cabdrivers  association <eos>
<sos> dinner in london somewhere  silence with a yawn or two accompanied this <eos>
<sos> thrilling announcement  then the old specimen in the corner who <eos>
<sos> appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir anthony <eos>
<sos> macdonnell had left euston for the chief secretary is lodge or words to <eos>
<sos> that effect  to which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered <eos>
<sos> why  <eos>
<sos>  give us a squint at that literature  grandfather  the ancient mariner <eos>
<sos> put in  manifesting some natural impatience  <eos>
<sos>  and welcome  answered the elderly party thus addressed  <eos>
<sos> the sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles <eos>
<sos> which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears  <eos>
<sos>  are you bad in the eyes  the sympathetic personage like the townclerk <eos>
<sos> queried  <eos>
<sos>  why  answered the seafarer with the tartan beard  who seemingly was a <eos>
<sos> bit of a literary cove in his own small way  staring out of seagreen <eos>
<sos> portholes as you might well describe them as  i uses goggles reading  <eos>
<sos> sand in the red sea done that  one time i could read a book in the <eos>
<sos> dark  manner of speaking  the arabian nights entertainment was my <eos>
<sos> favourite and red as a rose is she  <eos>
<sos> hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what  <eos>
<sos> found drowned or the exploits of king willow  iremonger having made a <eos>
<sos> hundred and something second wicket not out for notts  during which <eos>
<sos> time  completely regardless of ire  the keeper was intensely occupied <eos>
<sos> loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched <eos>
<sos> him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it  all of them who were <eos>
<sos> sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions  <eos>
<sos> that is to say  either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial <eos>
<sos> remark  <eos>
<sos> to cut a long story short bloom  grasping the situation  was the first <eos>
<sos> to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first <eos>
<sos> and foremost  being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for <eos>
<sos> the occasion  taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine <eos>
<sos> host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were <eos>
<sos> not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming  making a <eos>
<sos> grand total of fourpence  the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four <eos>
<sos> coppers  literally the last of the mohicans   he having previously <eos>
<sos> spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him <eos>
<sos> in unmistakable figures  coffee 2d  confectionery do  and honestly well <eos>
<sos> worth twice the money once in a way  as wetherup used to remark  <eos>
<sos>  come  he counselled to close the séance  <eos>
<sos> seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the <eos>
<sos> shelter or shanty together and the élite society of oilskin and <eos>
<sos> company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their <eos>
<sos> dolce far niente  stephen  who confessed to still feeling poorly and <eos>
<sos> fagged out  paused at the  for a moment  the door  <eos>
<sos>  one thing i never understood  he said to be original on the spur of <eos>
<sos> the moment  why they put tables upside down at night  i mean chairs <eos>
<sos> upside down  on the tables in cafés  to which impromptu the <eos>
<sos> neverfailing bloom replied without a moment is hesitation  saying <eos>
<sos> straight off  <eos>
<sos>  to sweep the floor in the morning  <eos>
<sos> so saying he skipped around  nimbly considering  frankly at the same <eos>
<sos> time apologetic to get on his companion is right  a habit of his  by the <eos>
<sos> bye  his right side being  in classical idiom  his tender achilles  the <eos>
<sos> night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit <eos>
<sos> weak on his pins  <eos>
<sos>  it will  the air  do you good  bloom said  meaning also the walk  in a <eos>
<sos> moment  the only thing is to walk then you ll feel a different man  <eos>
<sos> come  it is not far  lean on me  <eos>
<sos> accordingly he passed his left arm in stephen is right and led him on <eos>
<sos> accordingly  <eos>
<sos>  yes  stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange <eos>
<sos> kind of flesh of a different man approach him  sinewless and wobbly and <eos>
<sos> all that  <eos>
<sos> anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones  brazier etc  where the <eos>
<sos> municipal supernumerary  ex gumley  was still to all intents and <eos>
<sos> purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy  as the adage has it  dreaming <eos>
<sos> of fresh fields and pastures new  and apropos of coffin of stones the <eos>
<sos> analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the <eos>
<sos> part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the <eos>
<sos> time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class  probably the <eos>
<sos> selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings  <eos>
<sos> so they turned on to chatting about music  a form of art for which <eos>
<sos> bloom  as a pure amateur  possessed the greatest love  as they made <eos>
<sos> tracks arm in arm across beresford place  wagnerian music  though <eos>
<sos> confessedly grand in its way  was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to <eos>
<sos> follow at the first go off but the music of mercadante is huguenots  <eos>
<sos> meyerbeer is seven last words on the cross and mozart is twelfth mass <eos>
<sos> he simply revelled in  the gloria in that being  to his mind  the <eos>
<sos> acme of first class music as such  literally knocking everything else <eos>
<sos> into a cocked hat  he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the <eos>
<sos> catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line <eos>
<sos> such as those moody and sankey hymns or _bid me to live and i will live <eos>
<sos> thy protestant to be_  he also yielded to none in his admiration of <eos>
<sos> rossini is stabat mater  a work simply abounding in immortal numbers  <eos>
<sos> in which his wife  madam marion tweedy  made a hit  a veritable <eos>
<sos> sensation  he might safely say  greatly adding to her other laurels and <eos>
<sos> putting the others totally in the shade  in the jesuit fathers  church <eos>
<sos> in upper gardiner street  the sacred edifice being thronged to the <eos>
<sos> doors to hear her with virtuosos  or virtuosi rather  there was the <eos>
<sos> unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it <eos>
<sos> to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was <eos>
<sos> a generally voiced desire for an encore  on the whole though favouring <eos>
<sos> preferably light opera of the don giovanni description and martha  <eos>
<sos> a gem in its line  he had a penchant  though with only a surface <eos>
<sos> knowledge  for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn  and <eos>
<sos> talking of that  taking it for granted he knew all about the old <eos>
<sos> favourites  he mentioned par excellence lionel is air in _martha  <eos>
<sos> m appari_  which  curiously enough  he had heard or overheard  to be <eos>
<sos> more accurate  on yesterday  a privilege he keenly appreciated  from <eos>
<sos> the lips of stephen is respected father  sung to perfection  a study of <eos>
<sos> the number  in fact  which made all the others take a back seat  <eos>
<sos> stephen  in reply to a politely put query  said he did not sing it but <eos>
<sos> launched out into praises of shakespeare is songs  at least of in or <eos>
<sos> about that period  the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near <eos>
<sos> gerard the herbalist  who anno ludendo hausi  doulandus  an <eos>
<sos> instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch  <eos>
<sos> whom b  did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded <eos>
<sos> familiar  for sixtyfive guineas and farnaby and son with their dux <eos>
<sos> and comes conceits and byrd  william  who played the virginals  he <eos>
<sos> said  in the queen is chapel or anywhere else he found them and one <eos>
<sos> tomkins who made toys or airs and john bull  <eos>
<sos> on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond <eos>
<sos> the swingchains a horse  dragging a sweeper  paced on the paven ground  <eos>
<sos> brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not <eos>
<sos> perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to <eos>
<sos> sixtyfive guineas and john bull  he inquired if it was john bull the <eos>
<sos> political celebrity of that ilk  as it struck him  the two identical <eos>
<sos> names  as a striking coincidence  <eos>
<sos> by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn  which perceiving  <eos>
<sos> bloom  who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual  plucked the other is <eos>
<sos> sleeve gently  jocosely remarking  <eos>
<sos>  our lives are in peril tonight  beware of the steamroller  <eos>
<sos> they thereupon stopped  bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth <eos>
<sos> anything like sixtyfive guineas  suddenly in evidence in the dark quite <eos>
<sos> near so that it seemed new  a different grouping of bones and even <eos>
<sos> flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker  a hipshaker  a <eos>
<sos> blackbuttocker  a taildangler  a headhanger putting his hind foot <eos>
<sos> foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch  busy with <eos>
<sos> his thoughts  but such a good poor brute he was sorry he had not a lump <eos>
<sos> of sugar but  as he wisely reflected  you could scarcely be prepared <eos>
<sos> for every emergency that might crop up  he was just a big nervous <eos>
<sos> foolish noodly kind of a horse  without a second care in the world  but <eos>
<sos> even a dog  he reflected  take that mongrel in barney kiernan is  of the <eos>
<sos> same size  would be a holy horror to face  but it was no animal is fault <eos>
<sos> in particular if he was built that way like the camel  ship of the <eos>
<sos> desert  distilling grapes into potheen in his hump  nine tenths of them <eos>
<sos> all could be caged or trained  nothing beyond the art of man barring <eos>
<sos> the bees  whale with a harpoon hairpin  alligator tickle the small of <eos>
<sos> his back and he sees the joke  chalk a circle for a rooster  tiger my <eos>
<sos> eagle eye  these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field <eos>
<sos> occupied his mind somewhat distracted from stephen is words while the <eos>
<sos> ship of the street was manœuvring and stephen went on about the highly <eos>
<sos> interesting old  <eos>
<sos>  what is this i was saying  ah  yes  my wife  he intimated  plunging _in <eos>
<sos> medias res_  would have the greatest of pleasure in making your <eos>
<sos> acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind  <eos>
<sos> he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen  <eos>
<sos> image of his mother  which was not quite the same as the usual handsome <eos>
<sos> blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after <eos>
<sos> as he was perhaps not that way built  <eos>
<sos> still  supposing he had his father is gift as he more than suspected  it <eos>
<sos> opened up new vistas in his mind such as lady fingall is irish <eos>
<sos> industries  concert on the preceding monday  and aristocracy in <eos>
<sos> general  <eos>
<sos> exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _youth here has <eos>
<sos> end_ by jans pieter sweelinck  a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows <eos>
<sos> come from  even more he liked an old german song of johannes jeep <eos>
<sos> about the clear sea and the voices of sirens  sweet murderers of men  <eos>
<sos> which boggled bloom a bit  <eos>
<sos> von der sirenen listigkeit <eos>
<sos> tun die poeten dichten  <eos>
<sos> these opening bars he sang and translated extempore  bloom  nodding  <eos>
<sos> said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which <eos>
<sos> he did  <eos>
<sos> a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that  the rarest of boons  <eos>
<sos> which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out  could <eos>
<sos> easily  if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice <eos>
<sos> production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the <eos>
<sos> bargain  command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and <eos>
<sos> procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entrée into <eos>
<sos> fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial <eos>
<sos> magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his <eos>
<sos> university degree of b  a   a huge ad in its way  and gentlemanly <eos>
<sos> bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would <eos>
<sos> infallibly score a distinct success  being blessed with brains which <eos>
<sos> also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites  if his <eos>
<sos> clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into <eos>
<sos> their good graces as he  a youthful tyro in society is sartorial <eos>
<sos> niceties  hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate <eos>
<sos> against you  it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily <eos>
<sos> foresee him participating in their musical and artistic <eos>
<sos> conversaziones during the festivities of the christmas season  for <eos>
<sos> choice  causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and <eos>
<sos> being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation  cases of which  as he <eos>
<sos> happened to know  were on record in fact  without giving the show away  <eos>
<sos> he himself once upon a time  if he cared to  could easily have  added <eos>
<sos> to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be <eos>
<sos> sneezed at  going hand in hand with his tuition fees  not  he <eos>
<sos> parenthesised  that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily <eos>
<sos> embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of <eos>
<sos> time  but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and <eos>
<sos> both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity <eos>
<sos> in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a <eos>
<sos> cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped  besides  though <eos>
<sos> taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree  original music like that  <eos>
<sos> different from the conventional rut  would rapidly have a great vogue <eos>
<sos> as it would be a decided novelty for dublin is musical world after the <eos>
<sos> usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public <eos>
<sos> by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their genus omne  yes  <eos>
<sos> beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and <eos>
<sos> he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high <eos>
<sos> place in the city is esteem where he could command a stiff figure and  <eos>
<sos> booking ahead  give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street <eos>
<sos> house  given a backerup  if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs  <eos>
<sos> so to speak  a big if  however  with some impetus of the goahead sort <eos>
<sos> to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too <eos>
<sos> much fêted prince of good fellows  and it need not detract from the <eos>
<sos> other by one iota as  being his own master  he would have heaps of time <eos>
<sos> to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing <eos>
<sos> without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything <eos>
<sos> derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone  in fact  he <eos>
<sos> had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other  <eos>
<sos> possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort  <eos>
<sos> hung on to him at all  <eos>
<sos> the horse was just then  and later on at a propitious opportunity he <eos>
<sos> purposed  bloom did   without anyway prying into his private affairs on <eos>
<sos> the fools step in where angels principle  advising him to sever his <eos>
<sos> connection with a certain budding practitioner who  he noticed  was <eos>
<sos> prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious <eos>
<sos> pretext when not present  deprecate him  or whatever you like to call <eos>
<sos> it which in bloom is humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side <eos>
<sos> of a person is character  no pun intended  <eos>
<sos> the horse having reached the end of his tether  so to speak  halted <eos>
<sos> and  rearing high a proud feathering tail  added his quota by letting <eos>
<sos> fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish  three <eos>
<sos> smoking globes of turds  slowly three times  one after another  from a <eos>
<sos> full crupper he mired  and humanely his driver waited till he  or she  <eos>
<sos> had ended  patient in his scythed car  <eos>
<sos> side by side bloom  profiting by the contretemps  with stephen passed <eos>
<sos> through the gap of the chains  divided by the upright  and  stepping <eos>
<sos> over a strand of mire  went across towards gardiner street lower  <eos>
<sos> stephen singing more boldly  but not loudly  the end of the ballad  <eos>
<sos> und alle schiffe brücken  <eos>
<sos> the driver never said a word  good  bad or indifferent  but merely <eos>
<sos> watched the two figures  as he sat on his lowbacked car  both black  <eos>
<sos> one full  one lean  walk towards the railway bridge  _to be married by <eos>
<sos> father maher_  as they walked they at times stopped and walked again <eos>
<sos> continuing their tête à tête  which  of course  he was utterly out <eos>
<sos> of  about sirens  enemies of man is reason  mingled with a number of <eos>
<sos> other topics of the same category  usurpers  historical cases of the <eos>
<sos> kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in <eos>
<sos> the sleeper car who in any case could not possibly hear because they <eos>
<sos> were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower gardiner <eos>
<sos> street and looked after their lowbacked car  <eos>
<sos>   17   <eos>
<sos> what parallel courses did bloom and stephen follow returning  <eos>
<sos> starting united both at normal walking pace from beresford place they <eos>
<sos> followed in the order named lower and middle gardiner streets and <eos>
<sos> mountjoy square  west  then  at reduced pace  each bearing left  <eos>
<sos> gardiner is place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of <eos>
<sos> temple street  then  at reduced pace with interruptions of halt  <eos>
<sos> bearing right  temple street  north  as far as hardwicke place  <eos>
<sos> approaching  disparate  at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the <eos>

<sos> did bloom discover common factors of similarity between their <eos>
<sos> respective like and unlike reactions to experience  <eos>
<sos> both were sensitive to artistic impressions  musical in preference to <eos>
<sos> plastic or pictorial  both preferred a continental to an insular manner <eos>
<sos> of life  a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence  both <eos>
<sos> indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of <eos>
<sos> heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox <eos>
<sos> religious  national  social and ethical doctrines  both admitted the <eos>
<sos> alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual <eos>
<sos> magnetism  <eos>
<sos> were their views on some points divergent  <eos>
<sos> stephen dissented openly from bloom is views on the importance of <eos>
<sos> dietary and civic selfhelp while bloom dissented tacitly from stephen is <eos>
<sos> views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature  <eos>

<sos> what reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884  1885  <eos>
<sos> 1886  1888  1892  1893  1904 did bloom make before their arrival at <eos>
<sos> their destination  <eos>
<sos> he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual <eos>
<sos> development and experience was regressively accompanied by a <eos>
<sos> restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations  <eos>
<sos> as in what ways  <eos>
<sos> from inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received  <eos>
<sos> existence with existence he was with any as any with any  from <eos>

<sos> what act did bloom make on their arrival at their destination  <eos>
<sos> at the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers  <eos>
<sos> number 7 eccles street  he inserted his hand mechanically into the back <eos>

<sos> was it there  <eos>
<sos> it was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on <eos>
<sos> the day but one preceding  <eos>
<sos> why was he doubly irritated  <eos>
<sos> because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded <eos>
<sos> himself twice not to forget  <eos>
<sos> what were then the alternatives before the  premeditatedly <eos>
<sos>  respectively  and inadvertently  keyless couple  <eos>
<sos> to enter or not to enter  to knock or not to knock  <eos>
<sos> bloom is decision  <eos>
<sos> a stratagem  resting his feet on the dwarf wall  he climbed over the <eos>
<sos> area railings  compressed his hat on his head  grasped two points at <eos>
<sos> the lower union of rails and stiles  lowered his body gradually by its <eos>
<sos> length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten <eos>
<sos> inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in <eos>
<sos> space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in <eos>

<sos> which  by regulating  he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit <eos>
<sos> finally a portable candle  <eos>
<sos> what discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive  <eos>
<sos> reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent <eos>
<sos> kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 cp  a man lighting a <eos>
<sos> candle of 1 cp  a man removing in turn each of his two boots  a man <eos>
<sos> leaving the kitchen holding a candle  <eos>
<sos> did the man reappear elsewhere  <eos>
<sos> after a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible <eos>
<sos> through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the <eos>
<sos> halldoor  the halldoor turned gradually on its hinges  in the open <eos>

<sos> he extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its <eos>
<sos> flame  drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone  one for <eos>
<sos> stephen with its back to the area window  the other for himself when <eos>

<sos> flower and m donald of 14 d olier street  kindled it at three <eos>
<sos> projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match  thereby <eos>
<sos> releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its <eos>
<sos> carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen <eos>
<sos> of the air  <eos>
<sos> of what similar apparitions did stephen think  <eos>
<sos> of others elsewhere in other times who  kneeling on one knee or on two  <eos>

<sos> purposes other than those of consumption  envisaging the possibility of <eos>
<sos> recourse being had to the impotable water of the grand and royal canals <eos>
<sos> as in 1893  particularly as the south dublin guardians  notwithstanding <eos>
<sos> their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch <eos>
<sos> meter  had been convicted of a wastage of 20 000 gallons per night by a <eos>

<sos> what reason did stephen give for declining bloom is offer  <eos>
<sos> that he was hydrophobe  hating partial contact by immersion or total by <eos>
<sos> submersion in cold water   his last bath having taken place in the <eos>
<sos> month of october of the preceding year   disliking the aqueous <eos>
<sos> substances of glass and crystal  distrusting aquacities of thought and <eos>
<sos> language  <eos>
<sos> what impeded bloom from giving stephen counsels of hygiene and <eos>

<sos> ether  heat  convected   a mode of motion developed by such combustion  <eos>
<sos> was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of <eos>

<sos> sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving <eos>
<sos> and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected <eos>
<sos> and applied adhered  which was to be done  <eos>
<sos> why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise  <eos>
<sos> because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine <eos>
<sos> feminine passive active hand  <eos>
<sos> what quality did it  his hand  possess but with what counteracting <eos>
<sos> influence  <eos>
<sos> the operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human <eos>

<sos> what relation existed between their ages  <eos>
<sos> 16 years before in 1888 when bloom was of stephen is present age stephen <eos>
<sos> was 6  16 years after in 1920 when stephen would be of bloom is present <eos>
<sos> age bloom would be 54  in 1936 when bloom would be 70 and stephen 54 <eos>
<sos> their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1 2 to 13 <eos>
<sos> 1 2  the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according <eos>
<sos> as arbitrary future years were added  for if the proportion existing in <eos>
<sos> 1883 had continued immutable  conceiving that to be possible  till then <eos>
<sos> 1904 when stephen was 22 bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when stephen <eos>
<sos> would be 38  as bloom then was  bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when <eos>
<sos> stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 bloom  <eos>
<sos> being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714  would have <eos>
<sos> surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age  that of <eos>
<sos> methusalah  969 years  while  if stephen would continue to live until <eos>
<sos> he would attain that age in the year 3072 a d   bloom would have been <eos>
<sos> obliged to have been alive 83 300 years  having been obliged to have <eos>
<sos> been born in the year 81 396 b c  <eos>
<sos> what events might nullify these calculations  <eos>
<sos> the cessation of existence of both or either  the inauguration of a new <eos>
<sos> era or calendar  the annihilation of the world and consequent <eos>
<sos> extermination of the human species  inevitable but impredictable  <eos>
<sos> how many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance  <eos>
<sos> two  the first in the lilacgarden of matthew dillon is house  medina <eos>
<sos> villa  kimmage road  roundtown  in 1887  in the company of stephen is <eos>
<sos> mother  stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his <eos>
<sos> hand in salutation  the second in the coffeeroom of breslin is hotel on <eos>
<sos> a rainy sunday in the january of 1892  in the company of stephen is <eos>
<sos> father and stephen is granduncle  stephen being then 5 years older  <eos>
<sos> did bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and <eos>
<sos> afterwards seconded by the father  <eos>
<sos> very gratefully  with grateful appreciation  with sincere appreciative <eos>
<sos> gratitude  in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret  he declined  <eos>
<sos> did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a <eos>
<sos> third connecting link between them  <eos>
<sos> mrs riordan  dante   a widow of independent means  had resided in the <eos>
<sos> house of stephen is parents from 1 september 1888 to 29 december 1891 <eos>
<sos> and had also resided during the years 1892  1893 and 1894 in the city <eos>
<sos> arms hotel owned by elizabeth o dowd of 54 prussia street where  during <eos>
<sos> parts of the years 1893 and 1894  she had been a constant informant of <eos>
<sos> bloom who resided also in the same hotel  being at that time a clerk in <eos>
<sos> the employment of joseph cuffe of 5 smithfield for the superintendence <eos>
<sos> of sales in the adjacent dublin cattle market on the north circular <eos>
<sos> road  <eos>
<sos> had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her  <eos>
<sos> he had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings  an infirm widow <eos>
<sos> of independent  if limited  means  in her convalescent bathchair with <eos>
<sos> slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the north <eos>
<sos> circular road opposite mr gavin low is place of business where she had <eos>
<sos> remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular <eos>
<sos> fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars  roadster bicycles <eos>
<sos> equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres  hackney carriages  tandems  <eos>
<sos> private and hired landaus  dogcarts  ponytraps and brakes passing from <eos>
<sos> the city to the phoenix park and vice versa  <eos>
<sos> why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity  <eos>
<sos> because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of <eos>
<sos> bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with <eos>
<sos> continual changes of the thoroughfare without  pedestrians  quadrupeds  <eos>
<sos> velocipedes  vehicles  passing slowly  quickly  evenly  round and round <eos>
<sos> and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe  <eos>
<sos> what distinct different memories had each of her now eight years <eos>
<sos> deceased  <eos>
<sos> the older  her bezique cards and counters  her skye terrier  her <eos>
<sos> suppositious wealth  her lapses of responsiveness and incipient <eos>
<sos> catarrhal deafness  the younger  her lamp of colza oil before the <eos>
<sos> statue of the immaculate conception  her green and maroon brushes for <eos>
<sos> charles stewart parnell and for michael davitt  her tissue papers  <eos>
<sos> were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation <eos>
<sos> which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the <eos>
<sos> more desirable  <eos>
<sos> the indoor exercises  formerly intermittently practised  subsequently <eos>
<sos> abandoned  prescribed in eugen sandow is _physical strength and how to <eos>
<sos> obtain it_ which  designed particularly for commercial men engaged in <eos>
<sos> sedentary occupations  were to be made with mental concentration in <eos>
<sos> front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of <eos>
<sos> muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity  a more pleasant <eos>
<sos> relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility  <eos>
<sos> had any special agility been his in earlier youth  <eos>
<sos> though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full <eos>
<sos> circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a high school scholar he had <eos>
<sos> excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever <eos>
<sos> movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally <eos>
<sos> developed abdominal muscles  <eos>
<sos> did either openly allude to their racial difference  <eos>
<sos> neither  <eos>
<sos> what  reduced to their simplest reciprocal form  were bloom is thoughts <eos>
<sos> about stephen is thoughts about bloom and about stephen is thoughts about <eos>
<sos> bloom is thoughts about stephen  <eos>
<sos> he thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he <eos>
<sos> knew that he knew that he was not  <eos>
<sos> what  the enclosures of reticence removed  were their respective <eos>
<sos> parentages  <eos>
<sos> bloom  only born male transubstantial heir of rudolf virag <eos>
<sos>  subsequently rudolph bloom  of szombathely  vienna  budapest  milan  <eos>
<sos> london and dublin and of ellen higgins  second daughter of julius <eos>
<sos> higgins  born karoly  and fanny higgins  born hegarty   stephen  eldest <eos>
<sos> surviving male consubstantial heir of simon dedalus of cork and dublin <eos>
<sos> and of mary  daughter of richard and christina goulding  born grier   <eos>
<sos> had bloom and stephen been baptised  and where and by whom  cleric or <eos>
<sos> layman  <eos>
<sos> bloom  three times   by the reverend mr gilmer johnston m  a   alone  <eos>
<sos> in the protestant church of saint nicholas without  coombe  by james <eos>
<sos> o connor  philip gilligan and james fitzpatrick  together  under a pump <eos>
<sos> in the village of swords  and by the reverend charles malone c  c   in <eos>
<sos> the church of the three patrons  rathgar  stephen  once  by the <eos>
<sos> reverend charles malone c  c   alone  in the church of the three <eos>
<sos> patrons  rathgar  <eos>
<sos> did they find their educational careers similar  <eos>
<sos> substituting stephen for bloom stoom would have passed successively <eos>
<sos> through a dame is school and the high school  substituting bloom for <eos>
<sos> stephen blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory  <eos>
<sos> junior  middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the <eos>
<sos> matriculation  first arts  second arts and arts degree courses of the <eos>
<sos> royal university  <eos>
<sos> why did bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the <eos>
<sos> university of life  <eos>
<sos> because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation <eos>
<sos> had or had not been already made by him to stephen or by stephen to <eos>
<sos> him  <eos>
<sos> what two temperaments did they individually represent  <eos>
<sos> the scientific  the artistic  <eos>
<sos> what proofs did bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards <eos>
<sos> applied  rather than towards pure  science  <eos>
<sos> certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in <eos>
<sos> a state of supine repletion to aid digestion  stimulated by his <eos>
<sos> appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once <eos>
<sos> revolutionary  for example  the aeronautic parachute  the reflecting <eos>
<sos> telescope  the spiral corkscrew  the safety pin  the mineral water <eos>
<sos> siphon  the canal lock with winch and sluice  the suction pump  <eos>
<sos> were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of <eos>
<sos> kindergarten  <eos>
<sos> yes  rendering obsolete popguns  elastic airbladders  games of hazard  <eos>
<sos> catapults  they comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the <eos>

<sos> mechanical orreries  arithmetical gelatine lozenges  geometrical to <eos>
<sos> correspond with zoological biscuits  globemap playing balls  <eos>
<sos> historically costumed dolls  <eos>
<sos> what also stimulated him in his cogitations  <eos>
<sos> the financial success achieved by ephraim marks and charles a  james  <eos>
<sos> the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 george is street  south  the latter at <eos>
<sos> his 6 1 2d shop and world is fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 <eos>

<sos> which example did he adduce to induce stephen to deduce that <eos>
<sos> originality  though producing its own reward  does not invariably <eos>
<sos> conduce to success  <eos>
<sos> his own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart  drawn <eos>
<sos> by a beast of burden  in which two smartly dressed girls were to be <eos>

<sos> of having  purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid  the toxin <eos>
<sos> aforesaid   at the general drapery store of james cullen  4 main <eos>

<sos> did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or <eos>
<sos> intuition  <eos>
<sos> coincidence  <eos>
<sos> did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see  <eos>
<sos> he preferred himself to see another is face and listen to another is <eos>
<sos> words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament <eos>
<sos> relieved  <eos>
<sos> did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to <eos>
<sos> him  described by the narrator as a pisgah sight of palestine or _the <eos>

<sos> what instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him <eos>
<sos> in favour of the lastmentioned  ninth  solution  <eos>
<sos> in disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper <eos>
<sos> with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were greek and irish and <eos>
<sos> hebrew characters  she had interrogated constantly at varying intervals <eos>

<sos> such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons  places and things  <eos>
<sos> the false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all <eos>
<sos> balances  proved true by construction  the counterbalance of her <eos>
<sos> proficiency of judgment regarding one person  proved true by <eos>
<sos> experiment  <eos>
<sos> how had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance  <eos>
<sos> variously  by leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a <eos>
<sos> certain page  by assuming in her  when alluding explanatorily  latent <eos>
<sos> knowledge  by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other is <eos>
<sos> ignorant lapse  <eos>
<sos> with what success had he attempted direct instruction  <eos>

<sos> accepting the analogy implied in his guest is parable which examples of <eos>

<sos> how was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages <eos>
<sos> made in substantiation of the oral comparison  <eos>
<sos> by juxtaposition  on the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior <eos>
<sos> literary style  entituled sweets of sin  produced by bloom and so <eos>
<sos> manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of <eos>
<sos> the table  with a pencil  supplied by stephen  stephen wrote the irish <eos>
<sos> characters for gee  eh  dee  em  simple and modified  and bloom in turn <eos>
<sos> wrote the hebrew characters ghimel  aleph  daleth and  in the absence <eos>
<sos> of mem  a substituted qoph  explaining their arithmetical values as <eos>
<sos> ordinal and cardinal numbers  videlicet 3  1  4  and 100  <eos>
<sos> was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages  the <eos>
<sos> extinct and the revived  theoretical or practical  <eos>
<sos> theoretical  being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence <eos>
<sos> and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary  <eos>
<sos> what points of contact existed between these languages and between the <eos>

<sos> the presence of guttural sounds  diacritic aspirations  epenthetic and <eos>

<sos> nefesch  jehudi  homijah  <eos>
<sos> why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich  <eos>
<sos> in consequence of defective mnemotechnic  <eos>
<sos> how did the chanter compensate for this deficiency  <eos>
<sos> by a periphrastic version of the general text  <eos>
<sos> in what common study did their mutual reflections merge  <eos>
<sos> the increasing simplification traceable from the egyptian epigraphic <eos>
<sos> hieroglyphs to the greek and roman alphabets and the anticipation of <eos>
<sos> modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions <eos>
<sos>  semitic  and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing  celtic   <eos>
<sos> did the guest comply with his host is request  <eos>
<sos> doubly  by appending his signature in irish and roman characters  <eos>
<sos> what was stephen is auditive sensation  <eos>
<sos> he heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation <eos>
<sos> of the past  <eos>

<sos> she took him by the lilywhite hand <eos>
<sos> and led him along the hall <eos>
<sos> until she led him to a room <eos>
<sos> where none could hear him call  <eos>
<sos> she took a penknife out of her pocket <eos>

<sos> one of all  the least of all  is the victim predestined  once by <eos>
<sos> inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny  it comes when <eos>
<sos> he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and  as an apparition of <eos>
<sos> hope and youth  holds him unresisting  it leads him to a strange <eos>
<sos> habitation  to a secret infidel apartment  and there  implacable  <eos>
<sos> immolates him  consenting  <eos>
<sos> why was the host  victim predestined  sad  <eos>
<sos> he wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him <eos>
<sos> should by him not be told  <eos>
<sos> why was the host  reluctant  unresisting  still  <eos>
<sos> in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy  <eos>
<sos> why was the host  secret infidel  silent  <eos>
<sos> he weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder  the <eos>
<sos> incitations of the hierarchy  the superstition of the populace  the <eos>
<sos> propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity  the envy of <eos>
<sos> opulence  the influence of retaliation  the sporadic reappearance of <eos>

<sos> hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism  <eos>
<sos> from which  if any  of these mental or physical disorders was he not <eos>
<sos> totally immune  <eos>

<sos> indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds  from <eos>

<sos> in the direction of a heatless fire and  having attained its <eos>

<sos> not stated   <eos>
<sos> did that first division  portending a second division  afflict him  <eos>
<sos> less than he had imagined  more than he had hoped  <eos>
<sos> what second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly  <eos>
<sos> if differently  <eos>
<sos> a temporary departure of his cat  <eos>
<sos> why similarly  why differently  <eos>
<sos> similarly  because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male <eos>
<sos>  mullingar student  or of a healing herb  valerian   differently  <eos>
<sos> because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the <eos>
<sos> habitation  <eos>
<sos> in other respects were their differences similar  <eos>
<sos> in passivity  in economy  in the instinct of tradition  in <eos>
<sos> unexpectedness  <eos>

<sos> tumblerful of lemonade which it  he  had appeared to have accepted  cf <eos>
<sos> hearthdreaming cat   hence  in passivity  in economy  in the instinct <eos>
<sos> of tradition  in unexpectedness  their differences were similar  <eos>
<sos> in what way had he utilised gifts  1  an owl  2  a clock  given as <eos>
<sos> matrimonial auguries  to interest and to instruct her  <eos>
<sos> as object lessons to explain  1  the nature and habits of oviparous <eos>

<sos> progression  <eos>
<sos> in what manners did she reciprocate  <eos>
<sos> she remembered  on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to <eos>
<sos> him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown derby porcelain ware  <eos>
<sos> she provided  at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had <eos>
<sos> been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his <eos>

<sos> phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the <eos>
<sos> immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of <eos>

<sos> what proposal did bloom  diambulist  father of milly  somnambulist  <eos>
<sos> make to stephen  noctambulist  <eos>
<sos> to pass in repose the hours intervening between thursday  proper  and <eos>
<sos> friday  normal  on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately <eos>
<sos> above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of <eos>
<sos> his host and hostess  <eos>
<sos> what various advantages would or might have resulted from a <eos>
<sos> prolongation of such an extemporisation  <eos>
<sos> for the guest  security of domicile and seclusion of study  for the <eos>
<sos> host  rejuvenation of intelligence  vicarious satisfaction  for the <eos>
<sos> hostess  disintegration of obsession  acquisition of correct italian <eos>
<sos> pronunciation  <eos>
<sos> why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a <eos>
<sos> hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent <eos>
<sos> eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew is <eos>
<sos> daughter  <eos>
<sos> because the way to daughter led through mother  the way to mother <eos>
<sos> through daughter  <eos>
<sos> to what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest <eos>
<sos> return a monosyllabic negative answer  <eos>
<sos> if he had known the late mrs emily sinico  accidentally killed at <eos>
<sos> sydney parade railway station  14 october 1903  <eos>
<sos> what inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the <eos>
<sos> host  <eos>

<sos> of mrs mary dedalus  born goulding   26 june 1903  vigil of the <eos>
<sos> anniversary of the decease of rudolph bloom  born virag   <eos>
<sos> was the proposal of asylum accepted  <eos>
<sos> promptly  inexplicably  with amicability  gratefully it was declined  <eos>
<sos> what exchange of money took place between host and guest  <eos>
<sos> the former returned to the latter  without interest  a sum of money    <eos>
<sos> 1 7 0   one pound seven shillings sterling  advanced by the latter to <eos>
<sos> the former  <eos>

<sos> of a right line drawn between their residences  if both speakers were <eos>
<sos> resident in different places  fuck everyone who is reading this shit   <eos>
<sos> what rendered problematic for bloom the realisation of these mutually <eos>
<sos> selfexcluding propositions  <eos>
<sos> the irreparability of the past  once at a performance of albert <eos>
<sos> hengler is circus in the rotunda  rutland square  dublin  an intuitive <eos>
<sos> particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring <eos>
<sos> to a place in the auditorium where bloom  solitary  was seated and had <eos>
<sos> publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he  bloom  was his <eos>
<sos>  the clown is  papa  the imprevidibility of the future  once in the <eos>
<sos> summer of 1898 he  bloom  had marked a florin  2    with three notches <eos>
<sos> on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and <eos>
<sos> received by j  and t  davy  family grocers  1 charlemont mall  grand <eos>
<sos> canal  for circulation on the waters of civic finance  for possible  <eos>
<sos> circuitous or direct  return  <eos>
<sos> was the clown bloom is son  <eos>
<sos> no  <eos>
<sos> had bloom is coin returned  <eos>
<sos> never  <eos>
<sos> why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him  <eos>
<sos> because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to <eos>
<sos> amend many social conditions  the product of inequality and avarice and <eos>
<sos> international animosity  <eos>
<sos> he believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible  <eos>
<sos> eliminating these conditions  <eos>
<sos> there remained the generic conditions imposed by natural  as distinct <eos>
<sos> from human law  as integral parts of the human whole  the necessity of <eos>
<sos> destruction to procure alimentary sustenance  the painful character of <eos>
<sos> the ultimate functions of separate existence  the agonies of birth and <eos>
<sos> death  the monotonous menstruation of simian and  particularly  human <eos>
<sos> females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause  inevitable <eos>
<sos> accidents at sea  in mines and factories  certain very painful maladies <eos>
<sos> and their resultant surgical operations  innate lunacy and congenital <eos>
<sos> criminality  decimating epidemics  catastrophic cataclysms which make <eos>
<sos> terror the basis of human mentality  seismic upheavals the epicentres <eos>
<sos> of which are located in densely populated regions  the fact of vital <eos>
<sos> growth  through convulsions of metamorphosis  from infancy through <eos>
<sos> maturity to decay  <eos>
<sos> why did he desist from speculation  <eos>
<sos> because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other <eos>
<sos> more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena <eos>
<sos> to be removed  <eos>
<sos> did stephen participate in his dejection  <eos>
<sos> he affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding <eos>
<sos> syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational <eos>
<sos> reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon <eos>
<sos> the incertitude of the void  <eos>
<sos> was this affirmation apprehended by bloom  <eos>
<sos> not verbally  substantially  <eos>
<sos> what comforted his misapprehension  <eos>
<sos> that as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from <eos>
<sos> the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void  <eos>
<sos> in what order of precedence  with what attendant ceremony was the <eos>
<sos> exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation <eos>
<sos> effected  <eos>
<sos> lighted candle in stick borne by <eos>
<sos> bloom <eos>
<sos> diaconal hat on ashplant borne by <eos>
<sos> stephen <eos>
<sos> with what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm  <eos>
<sos> the 113th  _modus peregrinus  in exitu israël de egypto  domus jacob de <eos>
<sos> populo barbaro_  <eos>
<sos> what did each do at the door of egress  <eos>
<sos> bloom set the candlestick on the floor  stephen put the hat on his <eos>
<sos> head  <eos>
<sos> for what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress  <eos>
<sos> for a cat  <eos>
<sos> what spectacle confronted them when they  first the host  then the <eos>
<sos> guest  emerged silently  doubly dark  from obscurity by a passage from <eos>
<sos> the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden  <eos>
<sos> the heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit  <eos>
<sos> with what meditations did bloom accompany his demonstration to his <eos>
<sos> companion of various constellations  <eos>
<sos> meditations of evolution increasingly vaster  of the moon invisible in <eos>
<sos> incipient lunation  approaching perigee  of the infinite lattiginous <eos>
<sos> scintillating uncondensed milky way  discernible by daylight by an <eos>
<sos> observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 <eos>
<sos> ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth  of <eos>
<sos> sirius  alpha in canis maior  10 lightyears  57 000 000 000 000 miles  <eos>
<sos> distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet  of <eos>
<sos> arcturus  of the precession of equinoxes  of orion with belt and <eos>
<sos> sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could <eos>
<sos> be contained  of moribund and of nascent new stars such as nova in <eos>
<sos> 1901  of our system plunging towards the constellation of hercules  of <eos>
<sos> the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars  in reality <eos>
<sos> evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote <eos>
<sos> futures in comparison with which the years  threescore and ten  of <eos>
<sos> allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity  <eos>
<sos> were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast  <eos>
<sos> of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of <eos>
<sos> the earth  of the myriad minute entomological organic existences <eos>
<sos> concealed in cavities of the earth  beneath removable stones  in hives <eos>
<sos> and mounds  of microbes  germs  bacteria  bacilli  spermatozoa  of the <eos>
<sos> incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible <eos>
<sos> molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single <eos>
<sos> pinhead  of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white <eos>
<sos> bodies  themselves universes of void space constellated with other <eos>
<sos> bodies  each  in continuity  its universe of divisible component bodies <eos>
<sos> of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component <eos>
<sos> bodies  dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division <eos>
<sos> till  if the progress were carried far enough  nought nowhere was never <eos>
<sos> reached  <eos>
<sos> why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result  <eos>
<sos> because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of <eos>
<sos> the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a <eos>
<sos> number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such <eos>
<sos> magnitude and of so many places  e g   the 9th power of the 9th power <eos>
<sos> of 9  that  the result having been obtained  33 closely printed volumes <eos>
<sos> of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of india paper would <eos>
<sos> have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its <eos>
<sos> printed integers of units  tens  hundreds  thousands  tens of <eos>
<sos> thousands  hundreds of thousands  millions  tens of millions  hundreds <eos>
<sos> of millions  billions  the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of <eos>
<sos> every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to <eos>
<sos> the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers  <eos>
<sos> did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their <eos>
<sos> satellites by a race  given in species  and of the possible social and <eos>
<sos> moral redemption of said race by a redeemer  easier of solution  <eos>
<sos> of a different order of difficulty  conscious that the human organism  <eos>
<sos> normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons  when <eos>
<sos> elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere <eos>
<sos> suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity  according as the <eos>
<sos> line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was <eos>
<sos> approximated from nasal hemorrhage  impeded respiration and vertigo  <eos>
<sos> when proposing this problem for solution  he had conjectured as a <eos>
<sos> working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more <eos>
<sos> adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might <eos>
<sos> subsist otherwise under martian  mercurial  veneral  jovian  saturnian  <eos>
<sos> neptunian or uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions  though an <eos>
<sos> apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite <eos>
<sos> differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would <eos>
<sos> probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to <eos>
<sos> vanities  to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity  <eos>
<sos> and the problem of possible redemption  <eos>
<sos> the minor was proved by the major  <eos>
<sos> which various features of the constellations were in turn considered  <eos>

<sos> birth of the younger astroscopist  the annual recurrence of meteoric <eos>
<sos> showers about the period of the feast of s  lawrence  martyr  10 <eos>
<sos> august   the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon <eos>
<sos> in her arms  the posited influence of celestial on human bodies  the <eos>
<sos> appearance of a star  1st magnitude  of exceeding brilliancy dominating <eos>
<sos> by night and day  a new luminous sun generated by the collision and <eos>
<sos> amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns  about the <eos>
<sos> period of the birth of william shakespeare over delta in the recumbent <eos>
<sos> neversetting constellation of cassiopeia and of a star  2nd magnitude  <eos>
<sos> of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and <eos>
<sos> disappeared from the constellation of the corona septentrionalis about <eos>
<sos> the period of the birth of leopold bloom and of other stars of <eos>
<sos>  presumably  similar origin which had  effectively or presumably  <eos>
<sos> appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of andromeda about <eos>
<sos> the period of the birth of stephen dedalus  and in and from the <eos>
<sos> constellation of auriga some years after the birth and death of rudolph <eos>
<sos> bloom  junior  and in and from other constellations some years before <eos>
<sos> or after the birth or death of other persons  the attendant phenomena <eos>
<sos> of eclipses  solar and lunar  from immersion to emersion  abatement of <eos>
<sos> wind  transit of shadow  taciturnity of winged creatures  emergence of <eos>
<sos> nocturnal or crepuscular animals  persistence of infernal light  <eos>
<sos> obscurity of terrestrial waters  pallor of human beings  <eos>
<sos> his  bloom is  logical conclusion  having weighed the matter and <eos>
<sos> allowing for possible error  <eos>
<sos> that it was not a heaventree  not a heavengrot  not a heavenbeast  not <eos>
<sos> a heavenman  that it was a utopia  there being no known method from the <eos>
<sos> known to the unknown  an infinity renderable equally finite by the <eos>
<sos> suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and <eos>
<sos> of different magnitudes  a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in <eos>
<sos> space  remobilised in air  a past which possibly had ceased to exist as <eos>
<sos> a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present <eos>
<sos> existence  <eos>
<sos> was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle  <eos>
<sos> indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the <eos>
<sos> delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection <eos>
<sos> invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the <eos>
<sos> satellite of their planet  <eos>
<sos> did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological <eos>
<sos> influences upon sublunary disasters  <eos>
<sos> it seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the <eos>
<sos> nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to <eos>
<sos> verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy  the lake of dreams  the <eos>
<sos> sea of rains  the gulf of dews  the ocean of fecundity  <eos>
<sos> what special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and <eos>
<sos> woman  <eos>
<sos> her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian <eos>
<sos> generations  her nocturnal predominance  her satellitic dependence  her <eos>
<sos> luminary reflection  her constancy under all her phases  rising and <eos>
<sos> setting by her appointed times  waxing and waning  the forced <eos>
<sos> invariability of her aspect  her indeterminate response to <eos>
<sos> inaffirmative interrogation  her potency over effluent and refluent <eos>
<sos> waters  her power to enamour  to mortify  to invest with beauty  to <eos>
<sos> render insane  to incite to and aid delinquency  the tranquil <eos>
<sos> inscrutability of her visage  the terribility of her isolated dominant <eos>
<sos> implacable resplendent propinquity  her omens of tempest and of calm  <eos>
<sos> the stimulation of her light  her motion and her presence  the <eos>
<sos> admonition of her craters  her arid seas  her silence  her splendour  <eos>
<sos> when visible  her attraction  when invisible  <eos>
<sos> what visible luminous sign attracted bloom is  who attracted stephen is  <eos>
<sos> gaze  <eos>
<sos> in the second storey  rere  of his  bloom is  house the light of a <eos>
<sos> paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller <eos>
<sos> blind supplied by frank o hara  window blind  curtain pole and <eos>

<sos> how did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person  his <eos>
<sos> wife marion  molly  bloom  denoted by a visible splendid sign  a lamp  <eos>
<sos> with indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations  with subdued <eos>
<sos> affection and admiration  with description  with impediment  with <eos>
<sos> suggestion  <eos>
<sos> both then were silent  <eos>

<sos> the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow  <eos>
<sos> similarly  <eos>
<sos> the trajectories of their  first sequent  then simultaneous  urinations <eos>
<sos> were dissimilar  bloom is longer  less irruent  in the incomplete form <eos>
<sos> of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter  who in his ultimate <eos>
<sos> year at high school  1880  had been capable of attaining the point of <eos>
<sos> greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the <eos>
<sos> institution  210 scholars  stephen is higher  more sibilant  who in the <eos>
<sos> ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic <eos>
<sos> consumption an insistent vesical pressure  <eos>
<sos> what different problems presented themselves to each concerning the <eos>
<sos> invisible audible collateral organ of the other  <eos>
<sos> to bloom  the problems of irritability  tumescence  rigidity  <eos>
<sos> reactivity  dimension  sanitariness  pilosity  <eos>
<sos> to stephen  the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of jesus <eos>
<sos> circumcised  1 january  holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain <eos>
<sos> from unnecessary servile work  and the problem as to whether the divine <eos>
<sos> prepuce  the carnal bridal ring of the holy roman catholic apostolic <eos>
<sos> church  conserved in calcata  were deserving of simple hyperduly or of <eos>
<sos> the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine <eos>
<sos> excrescences as hair and toenails  <eos>
<sos> what celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed  <eos>
<sos> a star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament <eos>
<sos> from vega in the lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the <eos>
<sos> tress of berenice towards the zodiacal sign of leo  <eos>
<sos> how did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal <eos>

<sos> by inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an <eos>
<sos> unstable female lock  obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and <eos>
<sos> turning its wards from right to left  withdrawing a bolt from its <eos>
<sos> staple  pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and <eos>
<sos> revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress  <eos>
<sos> how did they take leave  one of the other  in separation  <eos>

<sos> female organism  passive but not obtuse  <eos>
<sos> jealousy  <eos>
<sos> because a nature full and volatile in its free state  was alternately <eos>
<sos> the agent and reagent of attraction  because attraction between <eos>
<sos> agent s  and reagent s  at all instants varied  with inverse proportion <eos>
<sos> of increase and decrease  with incessant circular extension and radial <eos>
<sos> reentrance  because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of <eos>
<sos> attraction produced  if desired  a fluctuation of pleasure  <eos>

<sos> met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long wrangle <eos>
<sos> in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in <eos>
<sos> with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as <eos>
<sos> i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a <eos>
<sos> letter when i came into the front room to show him dignams death in the <eos>
<sos> paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the <eos>
<sos> blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably <eos>
<sos> that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all <eos>
<sos> men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is <eos>
<sos> now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old <eos>
<sos> fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i <eos>
<sos> care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though <eos>
<sos> id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my <eos>
<sos> nose all the time like that slut that mary we had in ontario terrace <eos>
<sos> padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell <eos>
<sos> of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by <eos>
<sos> getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat <eos>
<sos> without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was <eos>
<sos> drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of <eos>
<sos> course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table <eos>
<sos> on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house stealing <eos>
<sos> my potatoes and the oysters 2 6 per doz going out to see her aunt if <eos>
<sos> you please common robbery so it was but i was sure he had something on <eos>
<sos> with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you <eos>
<sos> have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters <eos>
<sos> but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to be <eos>
<sos> alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters i <eos>
<sos> found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a <eos>
<sos> little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave <eos>
<sos> her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do <eos>
<sos> out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out <eos>
<sos> the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i <eos>
<sos> couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar <eos>
<sos> and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the <eos>
<sos> place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because <eos>
<sos> he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere <eos>
<sos> and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan <eos>
<sos> gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the tolka in my hand there <eos>
<sos> steals another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb <eos>
<sos> to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he <eos>
<sos> has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im dining out <eos>
<sos> and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the <eos>
<sos> satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be <eos>
<sos> always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some nicelooking <eos>
<sos> boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id <eos>
<sos> confuse him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my <eos>
<sos> garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him i <eos>
<sos> know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging <eos>
<sos> drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this <eos>
<sos> that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes i would <eos>
<sos> because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in <eos>
<sos> the jews temples gardens when i was knitting that woollen thing a <eos>
<sos> stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and <eos>
<sos> he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he <eos>
<sos> is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it <eos>
<sos> tell me his name who tell me who the german emperor is it yes imagine <eos>
<sos> im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what <eos>
<sos> he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply <eos>
<sos> ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it <eos>
<sos> till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your <eos>
<sos> lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the <eos>
<sos> world about it people make its only the first time after that its just <eos>
<sos> the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man <eos>
<sos> without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when <eos>
<sos> you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish <eos>
<sos> some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in <eos>
<sos> his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul <eos>
<sos> almost paralyses you then i hate that confession when i used to go to <eos>
<sos> father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and <eos>
<sos> i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my <eos>
<sos> child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where <eos>
<sos> you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done <eos>
<sos> with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put <eos>
<sos> it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he <eos>
<sos> want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat <eos>
<sos> hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he <eos>
<sos> id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar i wonder did he know me in <eos>
<sos> the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never <eos>
<sos> turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost <eos>
<sos> for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them <eos>
<sos> id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense <eos>
<sos> off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre <eos>
<sos> married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the <eos>
<sos> pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt <eos>
<sos> like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though <eos>
<sos> i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of <eos>
<sos> his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it <eos>
<sos> who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of <eos>
<sos> drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they <eos>
<sos> stick their bills up with some liqueur id like to sip those richlooking <eos>
<sos> green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with <eos>
<sos> the opera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american <eos>
<sos> that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do <eos>
<sos> to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took <eos>
<sos> the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt <eos>
<sos> lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i <eos>
<sos> popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful <eos>
<sos> to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when <eos>
<sos> i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful thunderbolts in <eos>
<sos> gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and <eos>
<sos> tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing <eos>
<sos> about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that <eos>
<sos> evening in whitefriars street chapel for the month of may see it <eos>
<sos> brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to <eos>
<sos> church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only <eos>
<sos> grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i <eos>
<sos> lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that <eos>
<sos> tremendous big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or <eos>
<sos> whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is <eos>
<sos> not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my <eos>
<sos> hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a <eos>
<sos> thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think <eos>
<sos> a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life <eos>
<sos> felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must <eos>
<sos> have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with <eos>
<sos> a big hole in the middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into <eos>
<sos> you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious <eos>
<sos> look in his eye i had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a <eos>
<sos> tremendous amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on <eos>
<sos> me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt <eos>
<sos> washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice <eos>
<sos> invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if <eos>
<sos> someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went <eos>
<sos> through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina <eos>
<sos> purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up <eos>
<sos> with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a <eos>
<sos> smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like <eos>
<sos> a nigger with a shock of hair on it jesusjack the child is a black the <eos>
<sos> last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and <eos>
<sos> bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied <eos>
<sos> till they have us swollen out like elephants or i dont know what <eos>
<sos> supposing i risked having another not off him though still if he was <eos>
<sos> married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has <eos>
<sos> more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting <eos>
<sos> josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him <eos>
<sos> off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good i <eos>
<sos> know they were spooning a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing <eos>
<sos> and sitting out with her the night of georgina simpsons housewarming <eos>
<sos> and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not <eos>
<sos> liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over <eos>
<sos> politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a <eos>
<sos> carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive <eos>
<sos> about everything i was fuming with myself after for giving in only for <eos>
<sos> i knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said he was he <eos>
<sos> annoyed me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot <eos>
<sos> of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside i often <eos>
<sos> wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family <eos>
<sos> physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was <eos>
<sos> crowded and watch him after that i pretended i had a coolness on with <eos>
<sos> her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever <eos>
<sos> he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me <eos>
<sos> the present of byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that <eos>
<sos> finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i <eos>
<sos> know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out <eos>
<sos> to see her somewhere id know if he refused to eat the onions i know <eos>
<sos> plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch <eos>
<sos> him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them <eos>
<sos> all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of <eos>
<sos> course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him <eos>
<sos> that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love <eos>
<sos> him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might <eos>
<sos> imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of <eos>
<sos> a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it <eos>
<sos> out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and <eos>
<sos> wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the <eos>
<sos> night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i <eos>
<sos> want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper <eos>
<sos> with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let out too <eos>
<sos> much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know <eos>
<sos> more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me josie <eos>
<sos> whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when i <eos>
<sos> said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash <eos>
<sos> possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick <eos>
<sos> when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the <eos>
<sos> indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what <eos>
<sos> spoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at <eos>
<sos> that time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he was <eos>
<sos> too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged <eos>
<sos> afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of <eos>
<sos> laughing with the giggles i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling <eos>
<sos> out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great <eos>
<sos> humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it <eos>
<sos> meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us <eos>
<sos> not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault <eos>
<sos> she didnt darken the door much after we were married i wonder what shes <eos>
<sos> got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her <eos>
<sos> face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she <eos>
<sos> must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment <eos>
<sos> she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk <eos>
<sos> about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes <eos>
<sos> he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him <eos>
<sos> just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might <eos>
<sos> murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes <eos>
<sos> mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when <eos>
<sos> he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he <eos>
<sos> always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and <eos>
<sos> now hes going about in his slippers to look for   10000 for a postcard <eos>
<sos> u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff <eos>
<sos> to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what <eos>
<sos> could you make of a man like that id rather die 20 times over than <eos>
<sos> marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like <eos>
<sos> me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and <eos>
<sos> he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs maybrick <eos>
<sos> that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man <eos>
<sos> yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and <eos>
<sos> do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating <eos>
<sos> drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask <eos>
<sos> us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because <eos>
<sos> they cant get on without us white arsenic she put in his tea off <eos>
<sos> flypaper wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say <eos>
<sos> its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have <eos>
<sos> been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being <eos>
<sos> hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do <eos>
<sos> besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they <eos>
<sos> theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he <eos>
<sos> noticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c <eos>
<sos> with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was waggling my foot we both <eos>
<sos> ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his <eos>
<sos> two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it <eos>
<sos> was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed <eos>
<sos> breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting <eos>
<sos> all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long <eos>
<sos> one i did i forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that i never got <eos>
<sos> after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish <eos>
<sos> times lost in the ladies lavatory d b c dame street finder return to <eos>
<sos> mrs marion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the <eos>
<sos> turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea <eos>
<sos> 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him <eos>
<sos> because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he <eos>
<sos> meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that <eos>
<sos> if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine ill <eos>
<sos> stick him for one and a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still <eos>
<sos> i made him spend once with my foot the night after goodwins botchup of <eos>
<sos> a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to <eos>
<sos> mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my <eos>
<sos> stockings lying on the hearthrug in lombard street west and another <eos>
<sos> time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i <eos>
<sos> could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world <eos>
<sos> that i what did he say i could give 9 points in 10 to katty lanner and <eos>
<sos> beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because <eos>
<sos> the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in <eos>
<sos> the lucan dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere <eos>
<sos> i noticed him when i was tasting the butter so i took my time bartell <eos>
<sos> darcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on <eos>
<sos> the choir stairs after i sang gounods ave maria what are we waiting <eos>
<sos> for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown <eos>
<sos> part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was <eos>
<sos> always raving about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his <eos>
<sos> mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a <eos>
<sos> place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him <eos>
<sos> about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there <eos>
<sos> and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it <eos>
<sos> or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an <eos>
<sos> idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got <eos>
<sos> me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me <eos>
<sos> to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming <eos>
<sos> along kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had <eos>
<sos> to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape <eos>
<sos> of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me <eos>
<sos> when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject <eos>
<sos> of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced <eos>
<sos> things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels <eos>
<sos> even when milly and i were out with him at the open air fete that one <eos>
<sos> in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see <eos>
<sos> every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain <eos>
<sos> i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the <eos>
<sos> harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the <eos>
<sos> zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking <eos>
<sos> slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they <eos>
<sos> can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on <eos>
<sos> it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were <eos>
<sos> you where are you going i could feel him coming along skulking after me <eos>
<sos> his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it <eos>
<sos> was getting too warm for him so i halfturned and stopped then he <eos>
<sos> pestered me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he <eos>
<sos> said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an <eos>
<sos> excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time <eos>
<sos> till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his <eos>
<sos> waistcoat pocket o maria santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in <eos>
<sos> the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them <eos>
<sos> and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the <eos>
<sos> sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet <eos>
<sos> if i didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you <eos>
<sos> never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it <eos>
<sos> if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers <eos>
<sos> outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him <eos>
<sos> from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he <eos>
<sos> circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do <eos>
<sos> everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting <eos>
<sos> all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the <eos>
<sos> butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me <eos>
<sos> that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to <eos>
<sos> any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we <eos>
<sos> met asking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw <eos>
<sos> i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was <eos>
<sos> always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky <eos>
<sos> man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake <eos>
<sos> dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it <eos>
<sos> used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in <eos>
<sos> gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children <eos>
<sos> seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice <eos>
<sos> a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman <eos>
<sos> when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then i wrote <eos>
<sos> the night he kissed my heart at dolphins barn i couldnt describe it <eos>
<sos> simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to <eos>
<sos> embrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the <eos>
<sos> same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you <eos>
<sos> think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the <eos>
<sos> door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface <eos>
<sos> goodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after <eos>
<sos> dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me <eos>
<sos> professor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in <eos>
<sos> his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out <eos>
<sos> you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today i <eos>
<sos> thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches <eos>
<sos> first and i was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was <eos>
<sos> trying to make a fool of me when i knew his tattarrattat at the door he <eos>
<sos> must have been a bit late because it was 1 4 after 3 when i saw the 2 <eos>
<sos> dedalus girls coming from school i never know the time even that watch <eos>
<sos> he gave me never seems to go properly id want to get it looked after <eos>
<sos> when i threw the penny to that lame sailor for england home and beauty <eos>

<sos> put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week <eos>
<sos> were to go to belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers <eos>
<sos> anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms <eos>
<sos> at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new <eos>
<sos> bed i couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next <eos>
<sos> room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the <eos>
<sos> wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all <eos>
<sos> very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we <eos>
<sos> never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes <eos>
<sos> going where he is besides something always happens with him the time <eos>
<sos> going to the mallow concert at maryborough ordering boiling soup for <eos>
<sos> the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with <eos>
<sos> the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and <eos>
<sos> the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion <eos>
<sos> for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two <eos>
<sos> gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was <eos>
<sos> too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a <eos>
<sos> good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd <eos>
<sos> have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him <eos>
<sos> o i love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i <eos>
<sos> wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the <eos>
<sos> train by tipping the guard well o i suppose therell be the usual idiots <eos>
<sos> of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly <eos>
<sos> be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone <eos>
<sos> in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something <eos>
<sos> about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the <eos>
<sos> window all the nicer then coming back suppose i never came back what <eos>

<sos> lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty <eos>
<sos> he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the <eos>
<sos> road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could <eos>
<sos> have made their peace in the beginning or old oom paul and the rest of <eos>
<sos> the other old krugers go and fight it out between them instead of <eos>
<sos> dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their <eos>
<sos> fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love <eos>
<sos> to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the spanish <eos>
<sos> cavalry at la roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from <eos>
<sos> algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham <eos>
<sos> battles on the 15 acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the <eos>
<sos> march past the 10th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o <eos>
<sos> the lancers theyre grand or the dublins that won tugela his father made <eos>
<sos> his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me <eos>
<sos> a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen <eos>
<sos> up there or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a mothball like <eos>
<sos> i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going <eos>
<sos> round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave <eos>
<sos> this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the <eos>
<sos> knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or <eos>
<sos> tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go <eos>
<sos> and smother themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money <eos>
<sos> and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i <eos>
<sos> could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit washy of course when <eos>
<sos> i looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the <eos>
<sos> expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with <eos>
<sos> his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat <eos>
<sos> always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from <eos>
<sos> behind the way mrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the <eos>
<sos> dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so <eos>
<sos> quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the <eos>
<sos> way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish <eos>
<sos> tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly <eos>
<sos> welloff i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he <eos>
<sos> was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the <eos>
<sos> stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 <eos>
<sos> quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for <eos>
<sos> me on account of lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that <eos>
<sos> sponger he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming <eos>
<sos> back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor <eos>
<sos> looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first <eos>
<sos> noticed him at dessert when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i <eos>
<sos> wished i could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my <eos>
<sos> fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for <eos>
<sos> i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers <eos>
<sos> were hallmarked silver too i wish i had some i could easily have <eos>
<sos> slipped a couple into my muff when i was playing with them then always <eos>
<sos> hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down <eos>
<sos> your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a <eos>
<sos> great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case <eos>
<sos> if its going to go on i want at least two other good chemises for one <eos>
<sos> thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i <eos>
<sos> think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them <eos>
<sos> either naked as god made them that andalusian singing her manola she <eos>
<sos> didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of <eos>
<sos> silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear i could have brought <eos>
<sos> them back to lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one <eos>
<sos> change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into <eos>
<sos> him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets id <eos>
<sos> want advertised cheap in the gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips <eos>
<sos> he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a <eos>
<sos> delightful figure line 11 6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance <eos>
<sos> across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill <eos>
<sos> have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it <eos>
<sos> the last they sent from orourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his <eos>
<sos> money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a <eos>
<sos> cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret <eos>
<sos> that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die <eos>
<sos> of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that <eos>
<sos> antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the <eos>
<sos> fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats <eos>
<sos> all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was <eos>
<sos> the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like <eos>
<sos> new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place <eos>
<sos> and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to <eos>
<sos> him ill know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose ill only have to <eos>
<sos> wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax <eos>
<sos> and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the <eos>
<sos> skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger <eos>
<sos> after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry <eos>
<sos> handkerchiefs about 6   in all sure you cant get on in this world <eos>
<sos> without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill lash it <eos>
<sos> around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea <eos>
<sos> into the pot measuring and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues <eos>
<sos> itself do you like those new shoes yes were they ive no clothes at all <eos>
<sos> the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners <eos>
<sos> 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the <eos>
<sos> other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because <eos>
<sos> they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every <eos>
<sos> day for the 4 years more i have of life up to 35 no im what am i at all <eos>
<sos> ill be 33 in september will i what o well look at that mrs galbraith <eos>
<sos> shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her beautys <eos>
<sos> on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down <eos>
<sos> to her waist tossing it back like that like kitty oshea in grantham <eos>
<sos> street 1st thing i did every morning to look across see her combing it <eos>
<sos> as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the <eos>
<sos> day before we left and that mrs langtry the jersey lily the prince of <eos>
<sos> wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the roads <eos>
<sos> only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black <eos>
<sos> mans id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny <eos>
<sos> story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster <eos>
<sos> knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and <eos>
<sos> the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing <eos>
<sos> like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master <eos>
<sos> francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her <eos>
<sos> ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and <eos>
<sos> her a e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that <eos>
<sos> pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody <eos>
<sos> can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that <eos>
<sos> twice i remember when i came to page 50 the part about where she hangs <eos>
<sos> him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a <eos>
<sos> woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out <eos>
<sos> of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the <eos>
<sos> crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have <eos>
<sos> a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of <eos>
<sos> her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and <eos>
<sos> she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar <eos>
<sos> the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too where he planted <eos>
<sos> the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me <eos>
<sos> too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to <eos>
<sos> chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it <eos>
<sos> and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank <eos>
<sos> where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day <eos>
<sos> of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with <eos>
<sos> him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe <eos>
<sos> like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching <eos>
<sos> about for advertisements when he could have been in mr cuffes still <eos>
<sos> only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could <eos>
<sos> have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada <eos>
<sos> once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly <eos>
<sos> mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that i <eos>
<sos> lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming <eos>
<sos> into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no <eos>
<sos> good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to todd and burns as <eos>
<sos> i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot <eos>
<sos> of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me <eos>
<sos> altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and <eos>
<sos> cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if i <eos>
<sos> went by his advices every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes <eos>
<sos> take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles <eos>
<sos> off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my <eos>
<sos> backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in <eos>
<sos> grafton street i had the misfortune to bring him into and she as <eos>
<sos> insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying im afraid were <eos>
<sos> giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of <eos>
<sos> her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second <eos>
<sos> time he looked poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but i could see <eos>
<sos> him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for <eos>
<sos> me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs <eos>
<sos> bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him <eos>
<sos> being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled <eos>
<sos> i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely <eos>
<sos> sorry and im sure you were <eos>
<sos> yes i think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he <eos>
<sos> made me thirsty titties he calls them i had to laugh yes this one <eos>
<sos> anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing ill get him to keep <eos>
<sos> that up and ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out <eos>
<sos> for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 <eos>
<sos> the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up <eos>
<sos> there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide <eos>
<sos> it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a <eos>
<sos> man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down <eos>
<sos> out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it <eos>
<sos> with a cabbageleaf that disgusting cameron highlander behind the meat <eos>
<sos> market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the <eos>
<sos> statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was <eos>
<sos> pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one <eos>
<sos> side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the surreys relieved <eos>
<sos> them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed <eos>
<sos> outside the mens greenhouse near the harcourt street station just to <eos>
<sos> try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7 <eos>
<sos> wonders of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night <eos>
<sos> coming home with poldy after the comerfords party oranges and lemonade <eos>
<sos> to make you feel nice and watery i went into 1 of them it was so biting <eos>
<sos> cold i couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was <eos>
<sos> a few months after a pity a couple of the camerons werent there to see <eos>
<sos> me squatting in the mens place meadero i tried to draw a picture of it <eos>
<sos> before i tore it up like a sausage or something i wonder theyre not <eos>
<sos> afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the <eos>
<sos> woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said i could pose for <eos>
<sos> a picture naked to some rich fellow in holles street when he lost the <eos>
<sos> job in helys and i was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee <eos>
<sos> palace would i be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes <eos>
<sos> only shes younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish <eos>
<sos> photo he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her <eos>
<sos> and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some <eos>
<sos> jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply <eos>
<sos> the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of <eos>
<sos> the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his <eos>
<sos> teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple i had to scream out arent <eos>
<sos> they fearful trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly <eos>
<sos> enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a <eos>
<sos> pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate <eos>
<sos> looking student that stopped in no 28 with the citrons penrose nearly <eos>
<sos> caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the towel to <eos>
<sos> my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till <eos>
<sos> he got doctor brady to give me the belladonna prescription i had to get <eos>
<sos> him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker <eos>
<sos> than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond <eos>
<sos> everything i declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if i only <eos>
<sos> could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it <eos>
<sos> the works of master poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an <eos>
<sos> hour he was at them im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant <eos>
<sos> i had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those <eos>
<sos> men get out of a woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch <eos>
<sos> myself i wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come <eos>
<sos> again like that i feel all fire inside me or if i could dream it when <eos>
<sos> he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger i was <eos>
<sos> coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him i had to hug him <eos>
<sos> after o lord i wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or <eos>
<sos> anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain <eos>
<sos> who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man <eos>
<sos> theyre not all like him thank god some of them want you to be so nice <eos>
<sos> about it i noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk i gave my <eos>

<sos> given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them <eos>
<sos> expecting you to walk up killiney hill then for example at that picnic <eos>
<sos> all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or <eos>

<sos> old bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 <eos>
<sos> things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the <eos>
<sos> women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole <eos>

<sos> opportunity at the band on the alameda esplanade when i was with father <eos>
<sos> and captain grove i looked up at the church first and then at the <eos>
<sos> windows then down and our eyes met i felt something go through me like <eos>
<sos> all needles my eyes were dancing i remember after when i looked at <eos>
<sos> myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was <eos>
<sos> attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent <eos>
<sos> looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like thomas in the <eos>
<sos> shadow of ashlydyat i had a splendid skin from the sun and the <eos>
<sos> excitement like a rose i didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been <eos>
<sos> nice on account of her but i could have stopped it in time she gave me <eos>

<sos> shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the <eos>
<sos> chair when i stood up they were so fattish and firm when i got up on <eos>
<sos> the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them <eos>
<sos> at night and the mosquito nets i couldnt read a line lord how long ago <eos>

<sos> always going away and we never i remember that day with the waves and <eos>
<sos> the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those <eos>

<sos> blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt i cry yes i believe i <eos>

<sos> gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage <eos>

<sos> away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or <eos>
<sos> aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me <eos>
<sos> waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and <eos>

<sos> everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when <eos>
<sos> general ulysses grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great <eos>
<sos> fellow landed off the ship and old sprague the consul that was there <eos>
<sos> from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the <eos>
<sos> son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums <eos>
<sos> rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with <eos>
<sos> messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their <eos>
<sos> jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men <eos>
<sos> to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the <eos>
<sos> gates and the bagpipes and only captain groves and father talking about <eos>
<sos> rorkes drift and plevna and sir garnet wolseley and gordon at khartoum <eos>
<sos> lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil <eos>
<sos> with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his <eos>
<sos> nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner <eos>

<sos> could write the answer in bed to let him imagine me short just a few <eos>
<sos> words not those long crossed letters atty dillon used to write to the <eos>
<sos> fellow that was something in the four courts that jilted her after out <eos>
<sos> of the ladies letterwriter when i told her to say a few simple words he <eos>
<sos> could twist how he liked not acting with precipat precipitancy with <eos>
<sos> equal candour the greatest earthly happiness answer to a gentlemans <eos>
<sos> proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing else its all very <eos>
<sos> fine for them but as for being a woman as soon as youre old they might <eos>
<sos> as well throw you out in the bottom of the ashpit  <eos>
<sos> mulveys was the first when i was in bed that morning and mrs rubio <eos>
<sos> brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her <eos>
<sos> to hand me and i pointing at them i couldnt think of the word a hairpin <eos>
<sos> to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her <eos>
<sos> in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her <eos>
<sos> appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles <eos>
<sos> with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the <eos>
<sos> atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack <eos>
<sos> flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken english sailors took <eos>
<sos> all the rock from them and because i didnt run into mass often enough <eos>
<sos> in santa maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there <eos>
<sos> was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black <eos>
<sos> blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on <eos>
<sos> easter sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell <eos>
<sos> bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his majestad an <eos>
<sos> admirer he signed it i near jumped out of my skin i wanted to pick him <eos>
<sos> up when i saw him following me along the calle real in the shop window <eos>
<sos> then he tipped me just in passing but i never thought hed write making <eos>
<sos> an appointment i had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it <eos>
<sos> up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill <eos>
<sos> instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps <eos>
<sos> singing i remember shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the <eos>
<sos> old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under <eos>
<sos> the moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what <eos>
<sos> kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was <eos>
<sos> sweetlike young i put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way <eos>
<sos> what did i tell him i was engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish <eos>
<sos> nobleman named don miguel de la flora and he believed me that i was to <eos>
<sos> be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in <eos>
<sos> jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things i told him true about <eos>
<sos> myself just for him to be imagining the spanish girls he didnt like i <eos>
<sos> suppose one of them wouldnt have him i got him excited he crushed all <eos>
<sos> the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and <eos>
<sos> the perragordas till i taught him cappoquin he came from he said on the <eos>
<sos> black water but it was too short then the day before he left may yes it <eos>
<sos> was may when the infant king of spain was born im always like that in <eos>
<sos> the spring id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the <eos>
<sos> rockgun near oharas tower i told him it was struck by lightning and all <eos>
<sos> about the old barbary apes they sent to clapham without a tail <eos>
<sos> careering all over the show on each others back mrs rubio said she was <eos>
<sos> a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of inces farm and <eos>
<sos> throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me i had that <eos>
<sos> white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as i could <eos>
<sos> without too openly they were just beginning to be plump i said i was <eos>
<sos> tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place i suppose it must be <eos>
<sos> the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those <eos>
<sos> frightful rocks and saint michaels cave with the icicles or whatever <eos>
<sos> they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots <eos>
<sos> im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to africa when <eos>
<sos> they die the ships out far like chips that was the malta boat passing <eos>
<sos> yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever <eos>
<sos> he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there i <eos>
<sos> was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness <eos>
<sos> out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last <eos>
<sos> day transparent kind of shirt he had i could see his chest pink he <eos>
<sos> wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but i wouldnt let him he was <eos>
<sos> awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me <eos>
<sos> with a child embarazada that old servant ines told me that one drop <eos>
<sos> even if it got into you at all after i tried with the banana but i was <eos>
<sos> afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once <eos>
<sos> took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered <eos>
<sos> with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of <eos>
<sos> youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with <eos>
<sos> you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling <eos>
<sos> there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes o yes i <eos>
<sos> pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but i <eos>
<sos> opened my legs i wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because i <eos>
<sos> had a skirt opening up the side i tormented the life out of him first <eos>
<sos> tickling him i loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt <eos>
<sos> awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the <eos>
<sos> same i liked him like that moaning i made him blush a little when i got <eos>
<sos> over him that way when i unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back <eos>
<sos> the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all buttons men down the <eos>
<sos> middle on the wrong side of them molly darling he called me what was <eos>

<sos> years if i said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put <eos>
<sos> his hands over my eyes to guess who i might recognise him hes young <eos>
<sos> still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is <eos>
<sos> quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has <eos>
<sos> she little knows what i did with her beloved husband before he ever <eos>
<sos> dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you <eos>
<sos> might say they could have put an article about it in the chronicle i <eos>
<sos> was a bit wild after when i blew out the old bag the biscuits were in <eos>
<sos> from benady bros and exploded it lord what a bang all the woodcocks and <eos>
<sos> pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle <eos>
<sos> hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to <eos>

<sos> hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he <eos>
<sos> always wore crooked as often as i settled it straight h m s calypso <eos>

<sos> preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle <eos>
<sos> and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers god send him sense and <eos>

<sos> looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige m <eos>
<sos> bloom youre looking blooming josie used to say after i married him well <eos>

<sos> sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at <eos>
<sos> the elevation weeks and weeks i kept the handkerchief under my pillow <eos>

<sos> that clumsy claddagh ring for luck that i gave gardner going to south <eos>
<sos> africa where those boers killed him with their war and fever but they <eos>
<sos> were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it <eos>
<sos> like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold <eos>

<sos> could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it <eos>
<sos> came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all <eos>
<sos> down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the <eos>
<sos> tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping <eos>
<sos> out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of <eos>

<sos> flannel trousers id like to have tattered them down off him before all <eos>
<sos> the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was <eos>
<sos> black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed <eos>
<sos> chap i dont know who he is with that other beauty burke out of the city <eos>
<sos> arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he <eos>
<sos> wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was <eos>
<sos> no love lost between us thats 1 consolation i wonder what kind is that <eos>
<sos> book he brought me sweets of sin by a gentleman of fashion some other <eos>
<sos> mr de kock i suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with <eos>
<sos> his tube from one woman to another i couldnt even change my new white <eos>
<sos> shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat i had with that feather <eos>
<sos> all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell <eos>
<sos> of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in catalan <eos>
<sos> bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the <eos>
<sos> fishermens baskets old luigi near a hundred they said came from genoa <eos>
<sos> and the tall old chap with the earrings i dont like a man you have to <eos>
<sos> climb up to to get at i suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago <eos>
<sos> besides i dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at <eos>
<sos> night i suppose ill have to put up with it i never brought a bit of <eos>
<sos> salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was <eos>
<sos> going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or <eos>
<sos> blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the <eos>
<sos> way his father did down in ennis like all the things he told father he <eos>
<sos> was going to do and me but i saw through him telling me all the lovely <eos>
<sos> places we could go for the honeymoon venice by moonlight with the <eos>
<sos> gondolas and the lake of como he had a picture cut out of some paper of <eos>
<sos> and mandolines and lanterns o how nice i said whatever i liked he was <eos>
<sos> going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry <eos>
<sos> my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the <eos>
<sos> plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old <eos>
<sos> beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and <eos>
<sos> put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of <eos>
<sos> that hardened criminal he was called in lloyds weekly news 20 years in <eos>
<sos> jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine <eos>
<sos> his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles <eos>
<sos> away from i couldnt rest easy till i bolted all the doors and windows <eos>
<sos> to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a <eos>
<sos> madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute <eos>
<sos> like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed <eos>
<sos> id cut them off him so i would not that hed be much use still better <eos>
<sos> than nothing the night i was sure i heard burglars in the kitchen and <eos>
<sos> he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was <eos>
<sos> looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits <eos>
<sos> making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit <eos>
<sos> there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling <eos>
<sos> especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl <eos>
<sos> down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather <eos>
<sos> instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed have to learn not <eos>
<sos> like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the <eos>
<sos> same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way <eos>
<sos> he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the <eos>
<sos> place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming <eos>
<sos> in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as <eos>
<sos> i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then <eos>
<sos> doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to <eos>
<sos> look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack <eos>
<sos> statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that i got <eos>
<sos> that little italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 <eos>
<sos> shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right <eos>
<sos> not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at <eos>
<sos> the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to <eos>
<sos> understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant <eos>
<sos> say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and <eos>
<sos> helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its <eos>
<sos> me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and laid on <eos>
<sos> the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see now <eos>
<sos> shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating me <eos>
<sos> whistling with those romps of murray girls calling for her can milly <eos>
<sos> come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her <eos>
<sos> round in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well <eos>
<sos> he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to <eos>
<sos> go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i <eos>
<sos> smelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button i <eos>
<sos> sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i <eos>
<sos> tell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a <eos>
<sos> parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out <eos>
<sos> no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your <eos>
<sos> blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle <eos>
<sos> blackbottom and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on <eos>
<sos> show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at <eos>
<sos> her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you <eos>
<sos> then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the only way in the <eos>
<sos> theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me <eos>
<sos> afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that <eos>
<sos> touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always <eos>
<sos> trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for <eos>
<sos> beerbohm tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed <eos>
<sos> like that for any trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me <eos>
<sos> there and looking away hes a bit daft i think i saw him after trying to <eos>
<sos> get near two stylishdressed ladies outside switzers window at the same <eos>
<sos> little game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but <eos>
<sos> he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the <eos>
<sos> broadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance <eos>
<sos> on her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands <eos>
<sos> swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything <eos>
<sos> deep yet i never came properly till i was what 22 or so it went into <eos>
<sos> the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that <eos>
<sos> conny connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with <eos>
<sos> sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he <eos>
<sos> looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and <eos>
<sos> supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man <eos>
<sos> gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a <eos>
<sos> few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it <eos>
<sos> really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love <eos>
<sos> in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each <eos>
<sos> other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit <eos>
<sos> foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and <eos>
<sos> poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes <eos>
<sos> always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to <eos>
<sos> put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time <eos>
<sos> enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes <eos>
<sos> pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too <eos>
<sos> but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a <eos>
<sos> fishwoman when i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we <eos>
<sos> met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to <eos>
<sos> see us in her trap with friery the solicitor we werent grand enough <eos>
<sos> till i gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that <eos>
<sos> now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me <eos>
<sos> that exasperated of course contradicting i was badtempered too because <eos>
<sos> how was it there was a weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night <eos>
<sos> before cheese i ate was it and i told her over and over again not to <eos>
<sos> leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as <eos>
<sos> she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith i will that was <eos>
<sos> the last time she turned on the teartap i was just like that myself <eos>
<sos> they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the <eos>
<sos> two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am i ever <eos>
<sos> going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming <eos>
<sos> id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that <eos>
<sos> old mrs fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the <eos>
<sos> things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course <eos>
<sos> shes old she cant help it a good job i found that rotten old smelly <eos>
<sos> dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser i knew there was something <eos>
<sos> and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends <eos>
<sos> to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you <eos>

<sos> man in the world besides theres something queer about their children <eos>
<sos> always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what <eos>
<sos> i did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one <eos>
<sos> thing gold maybe what a question if i smathered it all over his wrinkly <eos>
<sos> old face for him with all my compriments i suppose hed know then and <eos>
<sos> could you pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the <eos>
<sos> rock of gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by <eos>
<sos> the way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i <eos>
<sos> can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and <eos>
<sos> needles still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by <eos>
<sos> millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the <eos>
<sos> same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and <eos>
<sos> asking me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all <eos>
<sos> the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked <eos>
<sos> sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows <eos>
<sos> what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out <eos>
<sos> frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you <eos>
<sos> lying strap o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever <eos>
<sos> enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad <eos>
<sos> crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious <eos>
<sos> body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and <eos>
<sos> of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he <eos>
<sos> had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and i said i <eos>
<sos> hadnt are you sure o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him <eos>
<sos> up i knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited <eos>
<sos> me i dont know how the first night ever we met when i was living in <eos>
<sos> rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes <eos>
<sos> as if we met somewhere i suppose on account of my being jewess looking <eos>
<sos> after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half <eos>
<sos> sloothering smile on him and all the doyles said he was going to stand <eos>
<sos> for a member of parliament o wasnt i the born fool to believe all his <eos>
<sos> blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool <eos>
<sos> of a song out of the huguenots to sing in french to be more classy o <eos>
<sos> beau pays de la touraine that i never even sang once explaining and <eos>
<sos> rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy <eos>
<sos> anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st <eos>
<sos> opportunity he got a chance in brighton square running into my bedroom <eos>
<sos> pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the albion milk <eos>
<sos> and sulphur soap i used to use and the gelatine still round it o i <eos>
<sos> laughed myself sick at him that day i better not make an alnight <eos>
<sos> sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so <eos>
<sos> that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it i suppose <eos>
<sos> there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at <eos>
<sos> the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard <eos>
<sos> bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth <eos>
<sos> breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god he took me to <eos>
<sos> show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all yellow in a <eos>
<sos> pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out <eos>
<sos> that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and our lords both put <eos>
<sos> together all over asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody <eos>
<sos> i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big <eos>
<sos> square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway <eos>
<sos> wheres this those napkins are ah yes i know i hope the old press doesnt <eos>
<sos> creak ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere <eos>
<sos> still she must have given him great value for his money of course he <eos>
<sos> has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope theyll <eos>
<sos> have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up god <eos>
<sos> help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always <eos>
<sos> reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it often <eos>
<sos> enough and he thinks father bought it from lord napier that i used to <eos>
<sos> admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o i like <eos>
<sos> my bed god here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses <eos>
<sos> were we in at all raymond terrace and ontario terrace and lombard <eos>
<sos> street and holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on <eos>
<sos> the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the <eos>
<sos> men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse <eos>
<sos> and worse says warden daly that charming place on the landing always <eos>
<sos> somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always <eos>
<sos> know who was in there last every time were just getting on right <eos>
<sos> something happens or he puts his big foot in it thoms and helys and mr <eos>
<sos> cuffes and drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old <eos>
<sos> lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives <eos>
<sos> impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the <eos>
<sos> freeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the <eos>
<sos> freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along <eos>
<sos> in the wet all by himself round by coadys lane will give him much <eos>
<sos> consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely irish he is indeed <eos>
<sos> judging by the sincerity of the trousers i saw on him wait theres <eos>
<sos> georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well <eos>
<sos> thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody <eos>
<sos> climbing down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that <eos>
<sos> little habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if <eos>
<sos> he has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i <eos>
<sos> dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their <eos>
<sos> lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont <eos>
<sos> believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the aristocrats <eos>
<sos> masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in <eos>
<sos> real life without some old aristocrat or whatever his name is <eos>
<sos> disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads <eos>
<sos> and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about <eos>
<sos> with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow <eos>
<sos> poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both <eos>
<sos> sides and newlaid eggs i suppose im nothing any more when i wouldnt let <eos>
<sos> him lick me in holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the <eos>
<sos> one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews <eos>
<sos> used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast <eos>
<sos> or speak a word wanting to be petted so i thought i stood out enough <eos>
<sos> for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his <eos>
<sos> own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he forgets that <eos>
<sos> wethen i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and <eos>
<sos> lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles i wonder <eos>

<sos> the glencree dinner and ben dollard base barreltone the night he <eos>
<sos> borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in holles street squeezed and <eos>
<sos> squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a <eos>
<sos> wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough <eos>
<sos> that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5   in the <eos>
<sos> preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and <eos>
<sos> simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the <eos>
<sos> second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly <eos>

<sos> a delicious glorious voice phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart <eos>
<sos> sweetheart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet tart <eos>
<sos> goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in <eos>
<sos> it all over you like a warm showerbath o maritana wildwood flower we <eos>
<sos> sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even <eos>
<sos> transposed and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed <eos>
<sos> say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i <eos>
<sos> wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a <eos>
<sos> university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he <eos>
<sos> driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have <eos>
<sos> got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look <eos>
<sos> young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and <eos>
<sos> me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the kingsbridge <eos>
<sos> station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats 11 years ago <eos>
<sos> now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for <eos>
<sos> what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for <eos>
<sos> me i heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted <eos>
<sos> hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by this time <eos>
<sos> he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord <eos>
<sos> fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i saw <eos>
<sos> him at mat dillons he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god <eos>
<sos> yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out <eos>
<sos> the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met <eos>
<sos> before i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either <eos>
<sos> besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after <eos>
<sos> that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on <eos>
<sos> its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise <eos>
<sos> in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look <eos>
<sos> at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about <eos>
<sos> poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or <eos>
<sos> standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only <eos>
<sos> getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry <eos>
<sos> when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not <eos>
<sos> an ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i <eos>
<sos> wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 i was married 88 milly is 15 <eos>
<sos> yesterday 89 what age was he then at dillons 5 or 6 about 88 i suppose <eos>
<sos> hes 20 or more im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 i hope hes not <eos>
<sos> that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting <eos>
<sos> down in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of <eos>
<sos> course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was <eos>
<sos> out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not <eos>
<sos> a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson <eos>
<sos> they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont <eos>
<sos> find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where <eos>
<sos> poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully <eos>
<sos> coming back on the nightboat from tarifa the lighthouse at europa point <eos>
<sos> the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back <eos>
<sos> there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that <eos>
<sos> for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly <eos>
<sos> bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young <eos>
<sos> star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to <eos>
<sos> talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy prescotts <eos>
<sos> ad and keyess ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in <eos>
<sos> their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like <eos>
<sos> to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young <eos>
<sos> those fine young men i could see down in margate strand bathingplace <eos>
<sos> from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or <eos>
<sos> something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men <eos>
<sos> like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely <eos>
<sos> little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and <eos>
<sos> his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and <eos>
<sos> poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his <eos>
<sos> lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth <eos>
<sos> if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and <eos>
<sos> white he looks with his boyish face i would too in 1 2 a minute even if <eos>
<sos> some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no <eos>
<sos> danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men i <eos>
<sos> suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the <eos>
<sos> most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure <eos>
<sos> itll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age <eos>
<sos> ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till i see if the wishcard <eos>
<sos> comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out <eos>
<sos> ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew <eos>
<sos> who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the <eos>
<sos> same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him <eos>
<sos> till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and <eos>
<sos> mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he <eos>
<sos> becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though <eos>
<sos> no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no <eos>
<sos> nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because <eos>
<sos> i didnt call him hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a <eos>
<sos> cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place <eos>
<sos> pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so <eos>
<sos> barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar <eos>
<sos> way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a <eos>
<sos> butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of julius caesar of course <eos>
<sos> hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might <eos>
<sos> as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something <eos>
<sos> better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its <eos>
<sos> because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he <eos>
<sos> couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the <eos>
<sos> amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white <eos>
<sos> for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with <eos>
<sos> that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so <eos>
<sos> soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those <eos>
<sos> cornerboys saying passing the comer of marrowbone lane my aunt mary has <eos>
<sos> a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it <eos>
<sos> didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts <eos>
<sos> his thing long into my aunt marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be <eos>
<sos> you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick <eos>
<sos> and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl <eos>
<sos> for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street <eos>
<sos> no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me <eos>
<sos> up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands <eos>
<sos> jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling <eos>
<sos> her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if <eos>
<sos> he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he <eos>
<sos> going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course <eos>
<sos> the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either <eos>
<sos> its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all <eos>
<sos> those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can <eos>
<sos> i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with <eos>
<sos> him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the <eos>
<sos> wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a <eos>
<sos> womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything <eos>
<sos> unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of <eos>
<sos> us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the <eos>
<sos> dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita <eos>
<sos> theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a <eos>
<sos> madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a <eos>
<sos> woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young <eos>
<sos> no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the <eos>
<sos> fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking <eos>
<sos> would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd <eos>
<sos> know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not <eos>
<sos> care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of <eos>
<sos> those wildlooking gipsies in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near <eos>
<sos> the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could i only <eos>
<sos> sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back <eos>
<sos> over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow <eos>
<sos> with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me <eos>
<sos> up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do <eos>
<sos> themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up <eos>
<sos> somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us <eos>
<sos> the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course <eos>
<sos> it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and <eos>
<sos> when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after <eos>
<sos> coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his <eos>
<sos> wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten <eos>
<sos> again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the <eos>
<sos> love of mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well <eos>
<sos> he may sleep and sigh the great suggester don poldo de la flora if he <eos>
<sos> knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to <eos>
<sos> sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for <eos>
<sos> lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be slooching around <eos>
<sos> down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled <eos>
<sos> up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like <eos>
<sos> to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i <eos>
<sos> dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be <eos>
<sos> governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one <eos>
<sos> another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around <eos>
<sos> drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on <eos>
<sos> horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop <eos>
<sos> sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know <eos>
<sos> what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they <eos>
<sos> all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i <eos>
<sos> never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away <eos>
<sos> from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the <eos>
<sos> usual rowy house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a <eos>
<sos> fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to <eos>
<sos> make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two <eos>
<sos> dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that <eos>
<sos> disheartened me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in <eos>
<sos> that little woolly jacket i knitted crying as i was but give it to some <eos>
<sos> poor child but i knew well id never have another our 1st death too it <eos>
<sos> was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into <eos>
<sos> the glooms about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i <eos>
<sos> felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of <eos>
<sos> roving around the city meeting god knows who nightwalkers and <eos>
<sos> pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining <eos>
<sos> himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to <eos>
<sos> love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends <eos>
<sos> they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some <eos>
<sos> woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder <eos>
<sos> they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i <eos>
<sos> suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy im not like <eos>
<sos> that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i <eos>
<sos> suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the <eos>
<sos> next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i <eos>

<sos> two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the <eos>
<sos> spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant <eos>
<sos> what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and <eos>
<sos> wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in <eos>
<sos> bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad <eos>
<sos> luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and <eos>
<sos> something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might <eos>
<sos> like i never could bear the look of them in abrines i could do the <eos>
<sos> criada the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you <eos>
<sos> see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself <eos>
<sos> not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend <eos>
<sos> we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is <eos>
<sos> dos huevos estrellados senor lord the cracked things come into my head <eos>
<sos> sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres <eos>
<sos> the room upstairs empty and millys bed in the back room he could do his <eos>
<sos> writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he <eos>
<sos> does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes <eos>
<sos> making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 im sure im not going to <eos>
<sos> take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house <eos>
<sos> like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated <eos>
<sos> person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those turks with <eos>
<sos> the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown <eos>
<sos> that i badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long <eos>
<sos> ago in walpoles only 8 6 or 18 6 ill just give him one more chance ill <eos>
<sos> get up early in the morning im sick of cohens old bed in any case i <eos>
<sos> might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and <eos>
<sos> tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in <eos>
<sos> lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man id meet theyre out <eos>
<sos> looking for it in the morning mamy dillon used to say they are and the <eos>
<sos> night too that was her massgoing id love a big juicy pear now to melt <eos>
<sos> in your mouth like when i used to be in the longing way then ill throw <eos>
<sos> him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his <eos>
<sos> mouth bigger i suppose hed like my nice cream too i know what ill do <eos>
<sos> ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa <eos>
<sos> pieta masetto then ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son <eos>

<sos> mark of his spunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it <eos>
<sos> out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly <eos>
<sos> unless i made him stand there and put him into me ive a mind to tell <eos>
<sos> him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right <eos>
<sos> its all his own fault if i am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery <eos>
<sos> said o much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of <eos>
<sos> tears god knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i <eos>
<sos> suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt <eos>

<sos> face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes <eos>
<sos> there my brown part then ill tell him i want   1 or perhaps 30   ill <eos>
<sos> tell him i want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he <eos>
<sos> wont be too bad i dont want to soak it all out of him like other women <eos>
<sos> do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write <eos>
<sos> his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it <eos>
<sos> up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it off on me behind provided <eos>
<sos> he doesnt smear all my good drawers o i suppose that cant be helped ill <eos>

<sos> pleasure i could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and i <eos>

<sos> hester and father and old captain groves and the sailors playing all <eos>
<sos> birds fly and i say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the <eos>
<sos> pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing <eos>

<sos> morning the greeks and the jews and the arabs and the devil knows who <eos>
<sos> else from all the ends of europe and duke street and the fowl market <eos>
<sos> all clucking outside larby sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half <eos>
<sos> asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the <eos>
<sos> steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle <eos>
<sos> thousands of years old yes and those handsome moors all in white and <eos>
<sos> turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop <eos>
<sos> and ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice <eos>
<sos> hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night <eos>
<sos> and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at algeciras the <eos>
<sos> watchman going about serene with his lamp and o that awful deepdown <eos>
<sos> torrent o and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the <eos>
<sos> glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the alameda gardens yes and all <eos>
<sos> the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and <eos>
<sos> the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and <eos>
<sos> gibraltar as a girl where i was a flower of the mountain yes when i put <eos>
<sos> the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall i wear a <eos>
<sos> red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and i thought well <eos>
<sos> as well him as another and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again <eos>
<sos> yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and <eos>
