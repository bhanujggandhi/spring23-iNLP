<s> amongst the most violent against him was <title> bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters. <e>	2.723673182294555
<s> elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time <title> darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and <title> bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it. <e>	3.1969035916442823

<s> the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting. <e>	2.61991627812864
<s> when you told <title> bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else <e>	2.9520221784681406

<s> <title> hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently <title> darcy is eyes were fixed on her. <e>	3.0245473752407928
<s> she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange. <e>	3.2491886933710785

<s> indeed i do not dare. <e>	3.216965562279932
<s> elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. <e>	3.1346264363973964
<s> he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger. <e>	2.996105811233265
<s> miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth. <e>	2.569501751287887

<s> but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several years. <e>	2.897902747768457

<s> while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st. james is. <e>	2.911672211811562
<s> as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as <title> collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh. <e>	2.9355319362297845

<s> elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by <title> collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty. <e>	2.8036685632196994

<s> her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine is curiosity. <e>	3.056822873745702

<s> with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand. the envelope itself was likewise full. pursuing her way along the lane she then began it. <e>	2.5894689634683714
<s> it was dated from rosings at eight o clock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. <e>	2.5904846648588515
<s> you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice. <e>	2.480576145850116
<s> the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached <title> bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of <title> <e>	2.78861650474932
<s> wickham. wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison. but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your is i can only say that i am sorry. the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd. i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country. but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. i had often seen him in love before. at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas is accidental information that bingley is attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. <e>	3.073569121081881
<s> he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided. <e>	2.8724546976519876
<s> from that moment i observed my friend is behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him. <e>	3.0143217324546367
<s> your sister i also watched. her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening is scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error. <e>	3.0018547951988435
<s> your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable. <e>	3.102815835836535
<s> but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister is countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched. that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason. my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me. these causes must be stated though briefly. the situation of your mother is family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father. pardon me. it pains me to offend you. <e>	2.865098964083441
<s> but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection. he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning. the part which i acted is now to be explained. his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london. we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. i described and enforced them earnestly. but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister is indifference. <e>	2.8159707316284948
<s> he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard. but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. <e>	2.8563645062746885
<s> to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment. i cannot blame myself for having done thus much. <e>	2.7522298076523235
<s> there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister is being in town. <e>	3.034888581214182
<s> if i have wounded your sister is feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them. with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured <title> wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. <e>	2.8753771316453003
<s> of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. <e>	3.114052520182607
<s> <title> wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. <e>	3.158278463500752
<s> as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner. <e>	3.3650352897207703
<s> the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which <title> darcy could not have. <e>	2.927167361476602
<s> but whatever may be the sentiments which <title> wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character. <e>	2.637324057816013
<s> my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to <title> wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant. <e>	3.2492667785678875
<s> there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. <e>	2.284934037505349
<s> his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events <title> wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited. <e>	2.8729410731996743
<s> he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. <e>	2.89143218163997

<s> that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with <title> gardiner. <e>	2.7125197969769608

<s> elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning. <e>	3.3886186304767323
<s> elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing. <e>	2.6364161044531977
<s> from what we have seen of him continued <title> gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham. <e>	3.036593161413686

<s> but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue. <e>	3.0095070945123474
<s> elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham is so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire. <e>	3.2649392173823926
<s> in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on. <e>	3.206866990174603
<s> <title> gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else. <e>	3.1781049620561412
<s> elizabeth had settled it that <title> darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. <e>	3.2512555426025225

<s> from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. <e>	2.6368698358988087
<s> the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham is worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. <e>	2.9735625248336737
<s> he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. <e>	2.8796463881283394
<s> his character was to speak for itself. <e>	2.508766902007751
<s> he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. <e>	2.6236776996682982
<s> if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him. <e>	2.9743577165806867
<s> he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us. <e>	2.9503232201167098
<s> there is a lady it seems a <title> younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what. <e>	2.9836467651825873
<s> she then took a large house in edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. <e>	2.5137425761297356

<s> she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when. <e>	3.072765158291835
<s> he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia is flight on her own folly alone. <e>	2.693938468905906
<s> he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it. <e>	2.824109652689393
<s> he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on. <e>	3.324184595899852

<s> though <title> bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. <e>	3.771301286836163
<s> but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. <e>	2.774697269151663
<s> under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. <e>	3.010355866513654
<s> they met several times for there was much to be discussed. <e>	2.679157099132472
<s> wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable. <e>	2.926894178486937
<s> every thing being settled between them <title> darcy is next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home. <e>	3.122419704402449
<s> but <title> gardiner could not be seen and <title> darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning. <e>	3.153324195533768
<s> he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. <e>	2.947330409354982
<s> he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. <e>	3.0604005090987343

<s> he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one. <e>	2.7059115349024623
<s> but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due. <e>	2.820441183574463
<s> but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most. <e>	2.559277722185326
<s> you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people. <e>	2.8624184723555595
<s> his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased. <e>	2.9169672286042485
<s> the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above. <e>	3.455179577361641
<s> perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody is reserve can be answerable for the event. <e>	2.5508895904233717
<s> but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair. <e>	2.994856810833399
<s> when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish. <e>	3.2055252605419846
<s> lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house. <e>	2.6678342242496336
<s> he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane is letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain. <e>	3.180032725007576

<s> he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. <e>	2.7057366259542777

<s> she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side. <e>	3.026506690091681
<s> with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning. <e>	2.6840459991256447

<s> the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased <title> bennet is curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject. <e>	3.090093917117599
<s> the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand. <e>	3.045823847145451
