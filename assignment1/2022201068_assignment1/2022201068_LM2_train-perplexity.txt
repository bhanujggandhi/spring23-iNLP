<s> it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. <e>	2.1049396799028925
<s> she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas. <e>	2.940265002035978

<s> nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility. <e>	2.665436101288364

<s> and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty. <e>	2.4021165898080694
<s> the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting. <e>	1.80762327682463
<s> the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. <e>	1.97243603489503
<s> when you told <title> bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else. <e>	1.8978145550162955
<s> nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. <e>	2.2451664578926205
<s> and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment. <e>	2.3650147991125112
<s> at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies. <e>	2.19820229950714
<s> i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. <e>	2.831097670771746
<s> you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that <title> bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. <e>	2.5687546887184864
<s> you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself. <e>	2.374776967346816
<s> i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. <e>	1.8948694643251704
<s> but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could. <e>	2.154450445232859
<s> would <title> darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it. <e>	1.873939685201778
<s> upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself. <e>	2.1082993380440915
<s> you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged. <e>	2.5056390866323714
<s> allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety. <e>	1.956634887009098
<s> to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you. <e>	2.1582597387241087
<s> to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either. <e>	2.2977078456690996
<s> you appear to me <title> darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. <e>	2.465461480795764
<s> a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. <e>	1.8103503848595828
<s> i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about <title> bingley. <e>	2.4709384521348006
<s> will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties. <e>	1.9662480112738907
<s> by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of. <e>	1.985202809470994
<s> i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference. <e>	2.2409517255246425
<s> i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do. <e>	1.9839652512836938
<s> <title> darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh. <e>	2.4936669415258046
<s> miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense. <e>	2.054973175578961
<s> i see your design bingley said his friend. you dislike an argument and want to silence this. <e>	1.9784862681032773
<s> arguments are too much like disputes. <e>	3.1174731319850353
<s> if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me. <e>	2.4086137542604185
<s> what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and <title> darcy had much better finish his letter. <e>	2.509475700389418
<s> <title> darcy took her advice and did finish his letter. <e>	2.2742452496931818
<s> when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. <e>	2.6364893656684205
<s> miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself. <e>	1.9293454805419148
<s> <title> hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently <title> darcy is eyes were fixed on her. <e>	2.227126460318414
<s> she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange. <e>	2.419841638109453
<s> she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present. <e>	2.1332974679098116
<s> the supposition did not pain her. <e>	2.830421760537001
<s> she liked him too little to care for his approbation. <e>	2.569635259938845
<s> after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards <title> darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel. <e>	1.9748010911155724
<s> she smiled but made no answer. <e>	2.778143460722372
<s> he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence. <e>	2.4035457021818805
<s> said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply. <e>	2.811180057882864
<s> you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. <e>	1.9751618293481807
<s> i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare. <e>	2.354427483975306
<s> indeed i do not dare. <e>	4.467853482998962
<s> elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. <e>	2.164055499733641
<s> he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger. <e>	2.4426572514612515
<s> miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth. <e>	1.8811481927260916
<s> she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance. <e>	1.9385998260260313
<s> i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers. and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses. <e>	1.9860955560027655
<s> have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity. <e>	2.512564004799266
<s> yes. do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley. <e>	2.4241240413291445
<s> put them next to your great uncle the judge. <e>	2.4156647787579244
<s> they are in the same profession you know only in different lines. <e>	2.576413746523333
<s> as for your elizabeth is picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes. <e>	2.1905793468075734
<s> it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied. <e>	1.9680243844123084
<s> at that moment they were met from another walk by <title> hurst and elizabeth herself. <e>	2.3969036509292696
<s> i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard. <e>	2.72432632717426
<s> you used us abominably ill answered <title> hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out. <e>	2.179095887575564
<s> then taking the disengaged arm of <title> darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself. <e>	2.5532040574074912
<s> the path just admitted three. <e>	2.892212584150137
<s> <title> darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party. <e>	2.0001806453303876
<s> we had better go into the avenue. <e>	3.0668325260870604
<s> but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are. you are charmingly group d and appear to uncommon advantage. <e>	1.9449459159167628
<s> the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. <e>	2.3009957659121554
<s> she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. <e>	2.166088352658433
<s> jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening. <e>	2.1049143590284958
<s> when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. <e>	2.331020647128032
<s> their powers of conversation were considerable. <e>	2.825212971661069
<s> but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object. <e>	2.847400527282901
<s> miss bingley is eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. <e>	2.5457544875742517
<s> he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation <title> hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingley is salutation. <e>	2.08063494267632
<s> he was full of joy and attention. <e>	2.657658830340956
<s> the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door. <e>	2.1202982203052008
<s> elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight. <e>	2.233006615966324
<s> when tea was over <title> hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain. <e>	2.2967251921104292
<s> she had obtained private intelligence that <title> darcy did not wish for cards and <title> hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. <e>	2.1425947919223685
<s> she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. <e>	2.612194262994826
<s> <title> hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep. <e>	2.319314859778352
<s> miss bingley is attention was quite as much engaged in watching <title> darcy is progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page. <e>	2.3630752641754986
<s> she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on. <e>	2.12170427118329
<s> at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way. <e>	2.051873335422881
<s> i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading. <e>	2.8151901057369093

<s> she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield. i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure. <e>	1.822492635639336
<s> i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. <e>	2.166644807853319
<s> much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball. <e>	2.4790377495924782

<s> miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing <title> darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives. <e>	2.129008448420824
<s> i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak. <e>	2.647635768163576

<s> the idea of <title> collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish. <e>	1.933859675818554
<s> secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness. <e>	2.3229082598296436

<s> i am not now to learn replied <title> collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time. <e>	1.8703834833493747
<s> i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long. <e>	2.3075964548998584
<s> upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration. <e>	1.939060433722565

<s> and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not <title> collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character. <e>	1.9739732200620346
<s> really <title> collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly. <e>	2.33859316390209

<s> two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge. <e>	2.256871080952215
<s> the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached <title> bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of <title> <e>	1.9580817850690746
<s> wickham. wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison. but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your is i can only say that i am sorry. the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd. i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country. but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. i had often seen him in love before. at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas is accidental information that bingley is attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. <e>	1.925293794183029
<s> he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided. <e>	2.5471315910634096
<s> your sister i also watched. her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening is scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error. <e>	2.0307317268981264
<s> your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable. <e>	2.1595883597758423
<s> but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister is countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched. that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason. my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me. these causes must be stated though briefly. the situation of your mother is family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father. pardon me. it pains me to offend you. <e>	1.8150809586129797
<s> but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection. he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning. the part which i acted is now to be explained. his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london. we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. i described and enforced them earnestly. but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister is indifference. <e>	1.72380172381874
<s> he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard. but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. <e>	1.8944590172175373
<s> to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment. i cannot blame myself for having done thus much. <e>	1.9827366347195565
<s> i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me. it is done however and it was done for the best. on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer. <e>	2.1211541588168963
<s> if i have wounded your sister is feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them. with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured <title> wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. <e>	1.9817921029444832
<s> of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. <e>	2.2497546253058016
<s> my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman is education. <e>	2.1569849092453364
<s> my father was not only fond of this young man is society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it. <e>	2.126574816144931
<s> as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner. <e>	2.7735015447094207

<s> my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to <title> wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant. <e>	2.170556931765347
<s> there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. <e>	2.4018443128083073
<s> his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events <title> wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited. <e>	1.971283106392278
<s> he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. <e>	2.239831017836342

<s> all connection between us seemed now dissolved. <e>	2.56659583966036
<s> i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town. <e>	2.3520767037444297
<s> in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. <e>	1.9177740246424575
<s> for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. <e>	2.1898776683314227
<s> his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad. <e>	2.693089695729589

<s> you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it. <e>	1.9670055923972234

<s> before any answer could arrive from <title> collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge. <e>	2.0385827094564926
<s> the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. <e>	2.705326074562833

<s> at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw <title> darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. <e>	2.1936607639423893
<s> he bore it however with admirable calmness. <e>	2.6772241004652084

<s> if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight. <e>	2.750414714123765
<s> <title> philips is vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though <title> philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley is good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar. <e>	2.033596087300549
<s> nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant. <e>	2.3715118453942554
<s> elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley. <e>	1.9719766933533824
<s> happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which <title> bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. <e>	2.141690154666137
<s> with what delighted pride she afterwards visited <title> bingley and talked of <title> darcy may be guessed. <e>	2.7471250193648533
<s> i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly. <e>	1.9944230764052315
<s> <title> bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do. <e>	2.0727154736648266

<s> <title> bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth. <e>	2.778725054187382
<s> so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart. <e>	2.241058838891855
<s> the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other. <e>	2.0411770033428835
<s> from the farther disadvantage of lydia is society she was of course carefully kept and though <title> wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going. <e>	2.148671817234664

<s> but at length by elizabeth is persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city. <e>	2.0394050552457244
