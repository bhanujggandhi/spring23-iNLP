Average Perplexity 	 46.3809708360392
chapter i 	 13.249567417313715
it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife 	 49.939008187628694
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters 	 56.95306073737012
my dear <title> bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last 	 81.14951129272258
<title> bennet replied that he had not 	 14.100151782106384
but it is returned she for <title> long has just been here and she told me all about it 	 58.77708613389546
<title> bennet made no answer 	 15.951776330309308
do not you want to know who has taken it 	 35.690228592175856
cried his wife impatiently 	 33.21451580220824
you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it 	 18.231698978152174
this was invitation enough 	 109.24397450683838
why my dear you must know <title> long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with <title> morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week 	 50.435758142968595
what is his name 	 36.60019428815865
bingley 	 6.0319480990377325
is he married or single 	 104.1372595684851
oh 	 64.98411383749578
single my dear to be sure 	 47.89633838941698
a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year 	 40.81369734997566
what a fine thing for our girls 	 89.28911450438574
how so 	 17.104538979987176
how can it affect them 	 34.89009783162003
my dear <title> bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome 	 18.248211003256472
you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them 	 20.047886127800215
is that his design in settling here 	 112.91748671171466
design 	 14.009724179380786
nonsense how can you talk so 	 40.95334916368723
but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes 	 32.03124117331976
i see no occasion for that 	 28.67406335732522
you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them <title> bingley might like you the best of the party 	 65.19479853114514
my dear you flatter me 	 21.00289342991979
i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now 	 27.74441348461563
when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty 	 99.41448535204405
in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of 	 53.187785575545355
but my dear you must indeed go and see <title> bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood 	 36.06519266407218
it is more than i engage for i assure you 	 31.894361596282454
but consider your daughters 	 52.28818409784523
only think what an establishment it would be for one of them 	 52.14751352603139
sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers 	 79.10734993799728
indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not 	 25.908688858804496
you are over scrupulous surely 	 46.833172720718345
i dare say <title> bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy 	 37.497530720057334
i desire you will do no such thing 	 23.041741495588912
lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia 	 51.88208794582453
but you are always giving her the preference 	 53.08160365382338
they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters 	 90.56258647399353
<title> bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way 	 30.93644622333203
you take delight in vexing me 	 55.87000435571301
you have no compassion on my poor nerves 	 45.513458729436515
you mistake me my dear 	 47.557974545056375
i have a high respect for your nerves 	 94.36687425621989
they are my old friends 	 71.0234479044166
i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least 	 93.46030054944877
ah 	 38.75949711195059
you do not know what i suffer 	 11.495713966832604
but i hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood 	 41.5997766030746
it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them 	 101.71596386520999
depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all 	 53.78207126636083
<title> bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character 	 44.15877599612075
her mind was less difficult to develope 	 22.28925425273464
she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper 	 104.09187131215218
when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous 	 30.071752272789443
the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news 	 53.14275276045996
chapter ii 	 36.799539079808675
<title> bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on <title> bingley 	 31.95415163719116
he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it 	 36.60387027183585
it was then disclosed in the following manner 	 24.997200573119116
observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope <title> bingley will like it lizzy 	 57.15189015280413
we are not in a way to know what <title> bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit 	 35.30954518348859
but you forget mama said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that <title> long has promised to introduce him 	 40.50516678494068
i do not believe <title> long will do any such thing 	 23.629364780849343
she has two nieces of her own 	 30.442314883211157
she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her 	 22.392009520710637
no more have i said <title> bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you 	 28.649574260354253
<title> bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters 	 43.3740123858214
do not keep coughing so kitty for heaven is sake 	 38.228867621833224
have a little compassion on my nerves 	 48.65505353030671
you tear them to pieces 	 21.47810076936433
kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill 	 55.90774088574689
i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully 	 27.243244355154733
when is your next ball to be lizzy 	 68.5100249036465
to morrow fortnight 	 43.30576173970596
aye so it is cried her mother and <title> long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself 	 40.05377865488872
then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce <title> bingley to her 	 21.34227839228009
impossible <title> bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing 	 34.999023769357294
i honour your circumspection 	 42.4290108302604
a fortnight is acquaintance is certainly very little 	 61.813782342689315
one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight 	 57.78780018254228
but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all <title> long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself 	 68.93775035148488
the girls stared at their father 	 51.00150369838334
<title> bennet said only nonsense nonsense 	 68.53424955415579
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation 	 14.98146870824086
cried he 	 11.70368741072007
do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense 	 44.56532847636811
i cannot quite agree with you there 	 51.0907653460723
what say you mary 	 72.09051879943621
for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts 	 85.05878860357956
mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how 	 44.37317798708632
while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to <title> bingley 	 47.01499722899537
i am sick of <title> bingley cried his wife 	 34.50520621970365
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before 	 38.42060522342643
