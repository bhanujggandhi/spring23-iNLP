<s> by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother is admiration. <e>	3.432779108722309
<s> it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. <e>	3.364496482159823
<s> it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. <e>	3.800481250238434
<s> there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself. <e>	3.6725332970181643

<s> had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal. <e>	3.1381911841118355

<s> they insist also on my seeing <title> jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me. <e>	3.322548105336294
<s> yours c. well my dear said <title> bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of <title> bingley and under your orders. <e>	3.6379227737026003

<s> in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise. <e>	2.8776345463996194
<s> she was received however very politely by them and in their brother is manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness. <title> <e>	3.3410951866728946
<s> darcy said very little and <title> hurst nothing at all. <e>	3.79804175952697
<s> the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion is justifying her coming so far alone. <e>	3.1893155910843745
<s> the latter was thinking only of his breakfast. <e>	3.2826466231961713
<s> her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. <e>	3.638735607284673
<s> elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance. <e>	3.098591808786028
<s> she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. <e>	2.8893308149822734
<s> elizabeth silently attended her. <e>	3.8375992013093922
<s> when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane. <e>	3.2096064372288544
<s> the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts. <e>	3.414926813116544
<s> the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely. <e>	3.024535885876157

<s> when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so. <e>	3.323688496504062
<s> elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes. <e>	3.005843732169637
<s> to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of <title> bingley is she could not make a very favourable answer. <e>	3.7009281336193554
<s> jane was by no means better. <e>	3.998367721926615
<s> the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike. <e>	3.0802989840217627
<s> their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. <e>	4.144447235035323
<s> his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. <e>	3.0896115965778095
<s> miss bingley was engrossed by <title> darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for <title> hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her. <e>	3.086518772890409
<s> when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. <e>	3.7225759747259253
<s> her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty. <e>	3.330950564353364
<s> <title> hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker. <e>	3.435054407971549
<s> i shall never forget her appearance this morning. <e>	3.2111134976561906
<s> she really looked almost wild. <e>	3.894962512928877
<s> she did indeed louisa. <e>	3.9160896760887414
<s> i could hardly keep my countenance. <e>	3.3530678304862707
<s> very nonsensical to come at all. <e>	3.4514230857955774
<s> why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold. <e>	3.4052256880877434
<s> your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me. <e>	3.3979551168309676
<s> i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. <e>	3.469960257803613
<s> her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice. <e>	3.245059200974409
<s> you observed it <title> darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition. <e>	4.070058788396875
<s> what could she mean by it. <e>	3.5135681607533837
<s> it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley. <e>	4.431562341831673
<s> i am afraid <title> darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes. <e>	2.936370808348133
<s> a short pause followed this speech and <title> hurst began again. <e>	3.698568566776766
<s> i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled. <e>	3.080621094538358
<s> but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it. <e>	3.699508728395412
<s> i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton. <e>	2.9360688031809383
<s> yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside. <e>	3.285391033215027
<s> that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily. <e>	3.9357056732819724
<s> but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy. <e>	3.485136488745362
<s> to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend is vulgar relations. <e>	2.8307338941890228
<s> with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee. <e>	2.960547963528408
<s> she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself. <e>	3.608768281892919
<s> on entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book. <e>	3.1692248025553096
<s> do you prefer reading to cards. <e>	3.378428267336177
<s> miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards. <e>	3.596963843074285
<s> she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else. <e>	3.1252584508909775
<s> i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things. <e>	3.7249331097400544
<s> in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well. <e>	3.6318515161736076
<s> he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded. <e>	3.4162344467883097
<s> and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into. <e>	3.6909672372391666
<s> elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room. <e>	3.6767663892918985
<s> i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books. what a delightful library you have at pemberley <title> <e>	3.232117496935154
<s> it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations. <e>	3.6415359122760895
<s> and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books. <e>	3.322572768543518
<s> i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. <e>	2.90885281629587
<s> charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley. <e>	3.502195553110283
<s> i wish it may. <e>	3.914006544096941
<s> with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it. <e>	3.042607281588172
<s> i am talking of possibilities charles. <e>	3.5055081075901118
<s> upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation. <e>	3.1529944980448197
<s> elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between <title> bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game. <e>	3.1334709027399175
<s> said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am. <e>	3.855443962130391
<s> i think she will. <e>	3.535616260454415
<s> she is now about miss elizabeth bennet is height or rather taller. <e>	3.4059319532100267
<s> how i long to see her again. <e>	3.060470404154431
<s> such a countenance such manners. <e>	3.744352874155952
<s> and so extremely accomplished for her age. <e>	3.369615702110302
<s> her performance on the piano forte is exquisite. <e>	3.465230995288191
<s> it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are. <e>	3.2535620121244
<s> all young ladies accomplished. <e>	4.215580793080163
<s> my dear charles what do you mean. <e>	3.4057083165482482
<s> yes all of them i think. <e>	4.078734934628651
<s> they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses. <e>	2.933936851381462
<s> i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished. <e>	3.9469872516114775
<s> your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth. <e>	3.2846610328844674
<s> nor i i am sure said miss bingley. <e>	4.291413583881409
<s> then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman. <e>	3.3879603263122107
<s> yes i do comprehend a great deal in it. <e>	3.365207195226447
<s> certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. <e>	2.8772934933639727
<s> a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved. <e>	2.8630409655328375
<s> i rather wonder now at your knowing any. <e>	3.331422116592404
<s> are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this. <e>	3.331144671713073
<s> i never saw such a woman. <e>	2.9251950258554325
<s> i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united. <e>	2.8384481479397428
<s> <title> hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when <title> hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. <e>	2.6827538817042123
<s> as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room. <e>	3.352090064071378
<s> eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds. <e>	3.556360233343013
<s> undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. <e>	2.9941344371079732
<s> whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable. <e>	3.267199887506737
<s> this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother is proposal and it was settled that <title> jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better. <e>	3.6836493063631544
<s> they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister. <e>	2.8521781510410458
<s> elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister is room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from <title> bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. <e>	3.4838581326869016
<s> in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation. <e>	3.1786790645771834
<s> <title> bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast. <e>	3.296487510525933
<s> had she found jane in any apparent danger <title> bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield. <e>	3.216599188603166
<s> indeed i have sir was her answer. <e>	3.4680436875715803
<s> she is a great deal too ill to be moved. <e>	3.2212835054858835
<s> <title> jones says we must not think of moving her. <e>	3.9987833302077687
<s> we must trespass a little longer on your kindness. <e>	3.567631334622776
<s> it must not be thought of. <e>	4.114331977406224
<s> my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal. <e>	4.428120428446387
<s> you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us. <e>	3.0907662646718297
<s> <title> bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. <e>	3.3640072210717866
<s> i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. <e>	3.101190145107068
<s> you have a sweet room here <title> bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk. <e>	3.2720435726631245
<s> i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield. <e>	3.1493258031686104
<s> you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease. <e>	3.756216933622842
<s> whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes. <e>	3.280009018251821
<s> at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here. <e>	3.274391017275925
<s> you begin to comprehend me do you. <e>	3.554450383279515
<s> cried he turning towards her. <e>	3.583450054961754
<s> yes i understand you perfectly. <e>	3.719483048626906
<s> i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful. <e>	4.017770985191519
<s> it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours. <e>	2.9511472320443275
<s> lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home. <e>	3.452111364930004
<s> i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character. <e>	3.1008767797593952
<s> yes but intricate characters are the most amusing. <e>	3.31916697157378
<s> they have at least that advantage. <e>	3.5774635407596316
<s> the country said darcy can in general supply but few subjects for such a study. <e>	3.3695642170744926
<s> in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society. <e>	3.317838698524682
<s> but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever. <e>	3.473220829797031
<s> yes indeed cried <title> bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. <e>	3.3480909597013984
<s> every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away. <e>	3.8491152433024913
<s> indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother. <e>	3.4234762337589424
<s> you quite mistook <title> darcy. <e>	3.6525017574490684
<s> he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true. <e>	3.3994245709577497
<s> certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. <e>	3.3862457864060795
<s> i know we dine with four and twenty families. <e>	3.346157056219746
<s> nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance. <e>	3.2436400017039446
<s> his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards <title> darcy with a very expressive smile. <e>	3.415145074346484
<s> elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother is thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away. <e>	3.634276486801978
<s> yes she called yesterday with her father. <e>	3.4024906043692815

<s> so much the man of fashion. <e>	3.6326430825029736
<s> so genteel and so easy. he has always something to say to every body. that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter. <e>	2.925432961498806
<s> did charlotte dine with you. <e>	3.7233877774117667

<s> and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty. <e>	3.6266397445313294
<s> the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting. <e>	2.8857821338633136
<s> the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. <e>	2.8864269983826936
<s> when you told <title> bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else. <e>	3.0865814485459677
<s> nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. <e>	3.455758464997987
<s> at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies. <e>	3.249401343825385
<s> your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month. <e>	3.122242557164744
<s> you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that <title> bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. <e>	3.750056104358101
<s> i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. <e>	2.963419980835906
<s> but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could. <e>	3.213998764187317
<s> would <title> darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it. <e>	2.857981805153951
<s> upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself. <e>	2.9146217912101533
<s> you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged. <e>	3.675776083990429
<s> allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety. <e>	3.1542178574725233
<s> to yield readily easily to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you. <e>	3.2126625419365724

<s> you appear to me <title> darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. <e>	3.634491346924196
<s> a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. <e>	2.7553996232850055
<s> i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about <title> bingley. <e>	3.462052328857481
<s> we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. <e>	2.992634165764023
<s> by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of. <e>	3.072511957876269
<s> i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference. <e>	3.3583240050319016
<s> i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do. <e>	3.011946523505382
<s> <title> darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh. <e>	3.613040808759975
<s> miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense. <e>	3.1942945901041107
<s> i see your design bingley said his friend. you dislike an argument and want to silence this. <e>	2.9812063598417193

<s> what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and <title> darcy had much better finish his letter. <e>	3.734844702962545
<s> when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music. <e>	3.7592373502609466
<s> miss bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself. <e>	3.0121136303225327
<s> she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange. <e>	3.61601415139441
<s> the supposition did not pain her. <e>	3.7004412001469693
<s> she liked him too little to care for his approbation. <e>	3.676702735792239
<s> she smiled but made no answer. <e>	3.4642911683937503
<s> he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence. <e>	3.5432265480497334
<s> you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. <e>	3.246460049064293
<s> i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare. <e>	3.629846795011636
<s> indeed i do not dare. <e>	5.363578790929275
<s> elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. <e>	3.3445265101727797
<s> miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth. <e>	2.7296847915679803
<s> have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity. <e>	3.269042150510736
<s> yes. do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley. <e>	3.596829587490135
<s> they are in the same profession you know only in different lines. <e>	3.7105631052319534
<s> it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied. <e>	2.9467018917280776
<s> i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard. <e>	3.6049954881171136
<s> you used us abominably ill answered <title> hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out. <e>	3.2719088119253876
<s> then taking the disengaged arm of <title> darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself. <e>	3.6135023504490533
<s> the path just admitted three. <e>	3.806785496005525
<s> <title> darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party. <e>	3.030149087550805
<s> we had better go into the avenue. <e>	3.673442093107725

<s> when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. <e>	3.5248619673366437
<s> their powers of conversation were considerable. <e>	3.8062991914265387
<s> but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object. <e>	3.672888640809736
<s> miss bingley is eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. <e>	3.6282052698217937

<s> he was full of joy and attention. <e>	3.2864523421835417
<s> he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else. <e>	3.332016117795863
<s> elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight. <e>	3.093716357868416
<s> she had obtained private intelligence that <title> darcy did not wish for cards and <title> hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. <e>	3.2618875196206933
<s> she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. <e>	3.815179064047397
<s> <title> hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep. <e>	3.3363041372510627
<s> darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and <title> hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother is conversation with miss bennet. <e>	3.308871285901641

<s> if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards. <e>	3.210392617078557
<s> i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. <e>	3.2267051248199796
<s> it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day. <e>	2.9596886586541595

<s> elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately. <e>	2.962272002079762
<s> he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book. <e>	3.044116323215392
<s> he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. <e>	2.917199490161237
<s> what could he mean. <e>	3.9161219460461467

<s> not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it. <e>	3.1209829776851854
<s> miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing <title> darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives. <e>	3.2051091763723267

<s> the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her. <e>	3.0428536676492173

<s> he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from <title> darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only. <e>	3.428750609400705
<s> i have not a doubt of <title> bingley is sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. <e>	3.232058004663693
<s> <title> bingley is defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before. <e>	3.3348556480833795

<s> the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza. do you think it incredible that <title> collins should be able to procure any woman is good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you. <e>	3.172474708847938

<s> from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to <title> collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day. <e>	3.1663728206336184

<s> elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by <title> collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty. <e>	2.9387356658201593

<s> two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge. <e>	3.339111505608216
<s> wickham. wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison. but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your is i can only say that i am sorry. the necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd. i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country. but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. i had often seen him in love before. at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucas is accidental information that bingley is attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. <e>	3.123765411212527
<s> he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided. <e>	3.7468243861059274
<s> your sister i also watched. her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evening is scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error. <e>	3.211001818883244
<s> your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable. <e>	3.440306570519496
<s> but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister is countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched. that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason. my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me. these causes must be stated though briefly. the situation of your mother is family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father. pardon me. it pains me to offend you. <e>	2.9108699857306464
<s> but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection. he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning. the part which i acted is now to be explained. his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london. we accordingly went and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. i described and enforced them earnestly. but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sister is indifference. <e>	2.879358589577696
<s> he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard. but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own. to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. <e>	3.0644511032490915
<s> to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment. i cannot blame myself for having done thus much. <e>	3.0747276022389087
<s> there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister is being in town. <e>	3.359465711695427
<s> i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me. it is done however and it was done for the best. on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer. <e>	3.3382372234367237
<s> if i have wounded your sister is feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them. with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured <title> wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. <e>	3.118678985985293
<s> of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. <e>	3.5576542749523945
<s> <title> wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. <e>	3.3621385178469407
<s> my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentleman is education. <e>	3.287233076721234
<s> my father was not only fond of this young man is society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it. <e>	3.1703432832330525
<s> as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner. <e>	4.100955179169271
<s> the vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which <title> darcy could not have. <e>	3.169057283098316
<s> but whatever may be the sentiments which <title> wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character. <e>	3.0917764763889792
<s> it adds even another motive. <e>	3.767909243255681
<s> there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. <e>	3.251898348487461
<s> his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events <title> wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited. <e>	3.1782494567622352
<s> he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. <e>	3.3076528643072063
<s> i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. <e>	3.35948040289958
<s> i knew that <title> wickham ought not to be a clergyman. <e>	4.482259203623986
<s> the business was therefore soon settled. <e>	3.7453818541514035

<s> i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town. <e>	3.2589477334382657
<s> in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. <e>	3.0211688157252357

<s> you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it. <e>	2.7152271805528603

<s> with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield. <e>	3.4126320682553044
<s> she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. <e>	2.9919909988943494
<s> his belief of her sister is insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. <e>	3.3674080904350436

<s> but when this subject was succeeded by his account of <title> wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. <e>	2.913609233201278

<s> and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again. <e>	3.5398839787251815
<s> in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. <e>	3.1016282843734815
<s> the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late <title> darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words. <e>	3.3971144752410565
<s> so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great. <e>	3.2579948613977026
<s> what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. <e>	3.382301177382876

<s> but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render <title> darcy is conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole. <e>	3.2064844869750386

<s> how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned. <e>	3.9823766800760456

<s> every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of <title> darcy she could not but allow that <title> bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits. <e>	3.1547379514119616

<s> widely different was the effect of a second perusal. how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other. he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister is attachment and she could not help remembering what charlotte is opinion had always been. neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane. she felt that jane is feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility. <e>	3.259382349872469
<s> when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe. <e>	3.4824996767894194

<s> she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence <title> darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it. <e>	3.151471293746034

<s> to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther. <e>	3.3461904765943533

<s> elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham is name. <e>	4.1012903088528425
<s> their reception at home was most kind. <e>	3.53902451840698

<s> we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off. <e>	3.1639110578020118

<s> it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. <e>	4.31713375900946
<s> there was another reason too for her opposition. <e>	3.68760763952373

<s> elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last. <e>	3.070208404831057
<s> elizabeth is impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between <title> darcy and herself. <e>	3.4480166577895215
<s> miss bennet is astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. <e>	2.973627593253195
<s> she was sorry that <title> darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister is refusal must have given him. <e>	3.3231909008914093
<s> his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment. <e>	3.0453097131568043

<s> but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day. <e>	3.7344463795854295
<s> she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham. <e>	3.6914690460503894
<s> who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual. <e>	3.059501679388972
<s> nor was darcy is vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery. <e>	3.3702575691880305
<s> most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other. <e>	2.7871664501808855
<s> this will not do said elizabeth. <e>	4.016498373280319
<s> take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one. <e>	4.220715706327174

<s> it is really too distressing. <e>	3.2866970447862864
<s> no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. <e>	3.2470237981622296

<s> your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather. <e>	3.2975832587207727
<s> poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance. <e>	3.828748654795672
<s> there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. <e>	3.164224024422169
<s> one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it. <e>	3.831403200993687
<s> i never thought <title> darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do. <e>	3.386669914736827
<s> it is such a spur to one is genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind. <e>	3.2885175836758602
<s> lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now. <e>	3.6611041786541745
<s> indeed i could not. <e>	3.8818821502378396
<s> i was uncomfortable enough. <e>	3.5911778863457173
<s> i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy. <e>	3.4505547504637026
<s> and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had. <e>	3.647969797564577
<s> how i wanted you. <e>	3.653146218076414
<s> but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging. <e>	3.4109442484246304
<s> there is one point on which i want your advice. <e>	3.597923095236847
<s> what is your own opinion. <e>	3.9628389506221238
<s> that it ought not to be attempted. <e>	4.6101719066673565
<s> <title> darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. <e>	3.490786020915082
<s> on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me. <e>	3.507006671307501
<s> the general prejudice against <title> darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. <e>	3.6176400115031533
<s> i am not equal to it. <e>	3.504454928760114
<s> wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is. <e>	3.529356108331253
<s> sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. <e>	3.4009051087152584
<s> at present i will say nothing about it. <e>	3.2286816911258907
<s> you are quite right. <e>	3.5051542775117555
<s> to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. <e>	3.2688114966032606
<s> he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character. <e>	3.108576168606934
<s> we must not make him desperate. <e>	3.806548954362197
<s> the tumult of elizabeth is mind was allayed by this conversation. <e>	3.310281238283928
<s> she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either. <e>	2.984971848485031
<s> but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure. <e>	3.027442902027855
<s> she dared not relate the other half of <title> darcy is letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. <e>	3.6813903758543733
<s> here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery. <e>	3.1928502921725324
<s> and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. <e>	3.187314942437614
<s> the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value. <e>	3.390248165057433
<s> she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister is spirits. <e>	3.660600025724338
<s> jane was not happy. <e>	3.555724306920311
<s> she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley. <e>	3.3389777000076495
<s> having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity. <e>	3.099178699120689
<s> well lizzy said <title> bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of jane is. <e>	3.8338732694444264
<s> for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. <e>	3.1812021767211003
<s> i told my sister philips so the other day. <e>	3.3998187145957517
<s> but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london. <e>	3.5723738831309793
<s> well he is a very undeserving young man and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. <e>	4.042077935172769
<s> there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know. <e>	3.5880403984574425
<s> i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more. <e>	3.295275395243664
<s> it is just as he chooses. <e>	4.1341001393330785
<s> though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it. <e>	3.7237388373256763
<s> well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done. <e>	3.4644725941449503
<s> but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer. <e>	3.43106281084685
<s> well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they. <e>	3.1563533798506738
<s> well well i only hope it will last. <e>	3.779407352747843
<s> charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say. <e>	3.3556072665608454
<s> there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say. <e>	3.0272540821219533
<s> no nothing at all. <e>	3.666682958347307
<s> they will take care not to outrun their income. <e>	3.39210111773837
<s> they will never be distressed for money. <e>	3.6386944237821126
<s> and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead. <e>	2.9903821084409663
<s> they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens. <e>	3.867108004415653
<s> it was a subject which they could not mention before me. <e>	3.4229969782203584
<s> it would have been strange if they had. <e>	3.3064211062840037
<s> but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves. <e>	3.2144952548796244
<s> i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me. <e>	3.352520016176079
<s> the first week of their return was soon gone. <e>	3.44509676292601
<s> the second began. <e>	4.370680010798175
<s> it was the last of the regiment is stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. <e>	3.6736080627187127
<s> the dejection was almost universal. <e>	3.988324529669393
<s> the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments. <e>	2.945420739179473
<s> very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family. <e>	3.025361350096501
<s> would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. <e>	3.3838523348186613
<s> how can you be smiling so lizzy. <e>	2.997408874165123
<s> their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago. <e>	3.2552067455438456
<s> i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millar is regiment went away. <e>	2.905488072842635

<s> but the gloom of lydia is prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from <title> forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton. <e>	3.2447909906900354

<s> wholly inattentive to her sister is feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every one is congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish. <e>	2.9686845284279575
<s> i cannot see why <title> forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend. <e>	3.60485670973908

<s> if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia is unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair. <e>	3.120500577227616

<s> they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream. <e>	2.925649755354324

<s> that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with <title> gardiner. <e>	3.0732920351140054

<s> elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself. <e>	3.2615347577300136

<s> the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. <e>	3.500845625376066
<s> she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her. <e>	3.365796564652129
<s> they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought. <e>	3.3523981589854395
<s> elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased. <e>	3.502630561780246
<s> his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. <e>	3.957126634401848
<s> they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage <title> and <title> gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind. <e>	3.627268111001205
<s> he then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn. <e>	3.2331395695251537
<s> at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward. <e>	3.7583909039517933

<s> <title> darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house. <e>	3.0983921921129265
<s> the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected. <e>	3.260821497593465
<s> there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming. <e>	3.945824953087508
<s> i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it. <e>	3.1860162330994286
<s> i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. <e>	3.3660970373948245

<s> his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling. <e>	4.224764392321307
<s> to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickham is countenance for his features are perfectly good. <e>	3.394241431937857
<s> but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable. <e>	4.090579088083122
<s> elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning. <e>	3.8117091826213
<s> but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle. <e>	3.383874730729497
<s> your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds. <e>	3.2356967682729394
<s> elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing. <e>	3.502847331692555
<s> from what we have seen of him continued <title> gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham. <e>	3.4893057750305956
<s> he has not an ill natured look. <e>	3.771523068497578
<s> on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. <e>	3.285327249574784
<s> and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. <e>	3.4826780311179846
<s> but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character. <e>	3.224340376466784
<s> i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. <e>	3.327489232024665
<s> but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue. <e>	3.518764883309451
<s> elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham is so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire. <e>	3.4086837221546182
<s> in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on. <e>	3.6582704467853544
<s> <title> gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else. <e>	3.4744017236350033
<s> fatigued as she had been by the morning is walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance. <e>	3.3873590320983893
<s> the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of <title> darcy is civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister. <e>	3.413730129211177
<s> but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came. <e>	3.1427837440186446
<s> elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. <e>	2.7954398122222526
<s> her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business. <e>	3.261564337977013
<s> nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. <e>	3.2636491920773536
<s> she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her. <e>	2.7398404526341777
<s> miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place. <e>	3.3337822431419077

<s> she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. <e>	3.503410227848376
<s> all elizabeth is anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. <e>	3.1152670663028994

<s> to <title> and <title> gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. <e>	3.2636676400655

<s> the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention. <e>	3.2633037197032833

<s> of the lady is sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough. <e>	3.0881941800450856
<s> elizabeth on her side had much to do. <e>	3.8675717392844673

<s> he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months. <e>	3.6686924901279343

<s> never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings. <e>	2.859155196730805

<s> well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them. <e>	3.113482936170905
<s> if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight. <e>	3.4246110733901722

<s> well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man <title> stone. <e>	3.4462992581166696
<s> and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it. <e>	3.3916443831832126
<s> well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. <e>	3.839811866943286
<s> however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for <title> darcy might have done as well. <e>	3.740697969918458

<s> certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions. <e>	3.270599749857164
<s> thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry. <e>	3.5135219427782114
<s> on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away. <e>	3.527265329646292

<s> he came to tell <title> gardiner that he had found out where your sister and <title> wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once. <e>	4.120868529636567
<s> from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. <e>	3.0425632065125607
<s> the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickham is worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. <e>	3.285468691433577
<s> he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. <e>	3.275491361949092
<s> his character was to speak for itself. <e>	3.5634509443650475
<s> he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. <e>	2.9724438293946585
<s> he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us. <e>	3.260936730879145
<s> there is a lady it seems a <title> younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what. <e>	3.3453500100374605

<s> since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design. <e>	3.167597269396704
<s> he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia is flight on her own folly alone. <e>	2.9597726765464
<s> he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on. <e>	4.080565604552875
<s> <title> darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. <e>	3.8819289531181114
<s> though <title> bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. <e>	4.411111412903326
<s> under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. <e>	3.7342572084442778
<s> they met several times for there was much to be discussed. <e>	3.5667481546625734

<s> he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one. <e>	3.384822686297178
<s> nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole. <e>	4.114422788294194
<s> they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. <e>	3.302362767995775

<s> his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased. <e>	3.152614273102509
<s> the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above. <e>	4.314238517717527
<s> it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickham is character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. <e>	3.650139469543327
<s> perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybody is reserve can be answerable for the event. <e>	2.980929830448009
