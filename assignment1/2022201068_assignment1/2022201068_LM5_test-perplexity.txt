Average Perplexity 	 60.73666011174237
if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever 	 13.249567417313715
the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas 	 49.939008187628694
the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair 	 56.95306073737012
and on the gentlemen is approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men sha not come and part us i am determined 	 81.14951129272258
we want none of them do we 	 14.100151782106384
darcy had walked away to another part of the room 	 58.77708613389546
she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly 	 15.951776330309308
a man who has once been refused 	 35.690228592175856
how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love 	 33.21451580220824
is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman 	 18.231698978152174
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings 	 109.24397450683838
she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still 	 50.435758142968595
yes she will remain there till christmas 	 36.60019428815865
and quite alone 	 6.0319480990377325
have all her friends left her 	 104.1372595684851
<title> annesley is with her 	 64.98411383749578
the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks 	 47.89633838941698
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success 	 40.81369734997566
he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady is whispering to elizabeth again he walked away 	 89.28911450438574
when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother is rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party 	 17.104538979987176
she now lost every expectation of pleasure 	 34.89009783162003
they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself 	 18.248211003256472
<title> bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them 	 20.047886127800215
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day 	 112.91748671171466
i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you 	 14.009724179380786
the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw 	 40.95334916368723
the venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch 	 32.03124117331976
the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucas is last week and even <title> darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least 	 28.67406335732522
and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty 	 65.19479853114514
<title> long said so too for i asked her whether you did not 	 21.00289342991979
and what do you think she said besides 	 27.74441348461563
ah 	 99.41448535204405
<title> bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last 	 53.187785575545355
she did indeed 	 36.06519266407218
i do think <title> long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously 	 31.894361596282454
<title> bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingley is behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals 	 52.28818409784523
it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth 	 52.14751352603139
the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other 	 79.10734993799728
i hope we may often meet again 	 25.908688858804496
elizabeth smiled 	 46.833172720718345
lizzy you must not do so 	 37.497530720057334
you must not suspect me 	 23.041741495588912
it mortifies me 	 51.88208794582453
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it 	 53.08160365382338
i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection 	 90.56258647399353
it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man 	 30.93644622333203
you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment 	 55.87000435571301
how hard it is in some cases to be believed 	 45.513458729436515
and how impossible in others 	 47.557974545056375
but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge 	 94.36687425621989
that is a question which i hardly know how to answer 	 71.0234479044166
we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing 	 93.46030054944877
forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante 	 38.75949711195059
chapter xiii 	 11.495713966832604
a few days after this visit <title> bingley called again and alone 	 41.5997766030746
his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time 	 101.71596386520999
he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits 	 53.78207126636083
<title> bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere 	 44.15877599612075
next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky 	 22.28925425273464
he should be particularly happy at any time c 	 104.09187131215218
c 	 30.071752272789443
and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them 	 53.14275276045996
can you come to morrow 	 36.799539079808675
yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity 	 31.95415163719116
he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed 	 36.60387027183585
in ran <title> bennet to her daughter is room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down 	 24.997200573119116
he is come <title> bingley is come 	 57.15189015280413
he is indeed 	 35.30954518348859
make haste make haste 	 40.50516678494068
here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown 	 23.629364780849343
never mind miss lizzy is hair 	 30.442314883211157
we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago 	 22.392009520710637
oh 	 28.649574260354253
hang kitty 	 43.3740123858214
what has she to do with it 	 38.228867621833224
come be quick be quick 	 48.65505353030671
where is your sash my dear 	 21.47810076936433
but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters 	 55.90774088574689
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening 	 27.243244355154733
after tea <title> bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument 	 68.5100249036465
two obstacles of the five being thus removed <title> bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them 	 43.30576173970596
elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma 	 40.05377865488872
what do you keep winking at me for 	 21.34227839228009
what am i to do 	 34.999023769357294
nothing child nothing 	 42.4290108302604
i did not wink at you 	 61.813782342689315
she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room 	 57.78780018254228
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it 	 68.93775035148488
in a few minutes <title> bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you 	 51.00150369838334
elizabeth was forced to go 	 68.53424955415579
we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall 	 14.98146870824086
kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room 	 11.70368741072007
elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room 	 44.56532847636811
<title> bennet is schemes for this day were ineffectual 	 51.0907653460723
bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter 	 72.09051879943621
his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter 	 85.05878860357956
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and <title> bennet is means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband 	 44.37317798708632
after this day jane said no more of her indifference 	 47.01499722899537
not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless <title> darcy returned within the stated time 	 34.50520621970365
seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman is concurrence 	 38.42060522342643
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and <title> bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on 	 48.95163695768347
the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected 	 49.07780116439034
there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him 	 44.48542572297116
bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening <title> bennet is invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter 	 40.82567714298709
elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mother is schemes 	 32.851908948796506
but on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her 	 57.19490657437362
on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all 	 58.71765192560994
their situation was awkward enough but her is she thought was still worse 	 53.61384984910596
not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room 	 37.49975732905032
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world 	 67.8481841614758
tis too much 	 49.07007136843342
she added by far too much 	 50.54547216847678
i do not deserve it 	 39.24905358816617
oh 	 64.98411383749578
why is not every body as happy 	 27.203646805108757
elizabeth is congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express 	 33.00056638751271
every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane 	 31.172014979835254
but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present 	 50.42706834627012
i must go instantly to my mother she cried 	 51.141372992221356
i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself 	 61.15142061245234
he is gone to my father already 	 20.57473170035193
oh 	 38.43835526722801
lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family 	 34.268292738377475
how shall i bear so much happiness 	 56.13391555805893
she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty 	 48.555953506323995
elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation 	 54.00408823121409
and this said she is the end of all his friend is anxious circumspection 	 59.11841504151271
of all his sister is falsehood and contrivance 	 32.315404920359036
the happiest wisest most reasonable end 	 86.44180536641599
in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose 	 27.977401040885574
where is your sister 	 22.238309516022117
said he hastily as he opened the door 	 45.000677164980836
with my mother up stairs 	 53.424378914537904
she will be down in a moment i dare say 	 190.8823228749003
he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister 	 67.61174929220103
elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship 	 75.18667978105013
they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane is perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself 	 73.08817305541673
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennet is mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever 	 61.15131462364238
kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon 	 52.10112613632781
<title> bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when <title> bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was 	 60.766975136336356
not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you 	 92.23970956628477
you will be a very happy woman 	 49.42001731763364
jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness 	 50.856656980019096
you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled 	 44.21121988849926
i have not a doubt of your doing very well together 	 24.34306715893796
your tempers are by no means unlike 	 56.59765978234499
you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income 	 42.49799952502715
i hope not so 	 41.39719299963757
imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me 	 90.97236724684713
exceed their income 	 44.115349163814685
my dear <title> bennet cried his wife what are you talking of 	 22.769337870966787
why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more 	 34.81696987986047
then addressing her daughter oh 	 41.66917216640136
my dear dear jane i am so happy 	 28.40923502462069
i am sure i sha nt get a wink of sleep all night 	 27.817149045498994
i knew how it would be 	 67.04975955762094
i always said it must be so at last 	 49.67930627169722
i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing 	 64.98411383749578
i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together 	 36.36480002519113
oh 	 61.320602915216476
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen 	 33.071216311919024
wickham lydia were all forgotten 	 15.331422930822079
jane was beyond competition her favourite child 	 79.78184823030843
at that moment she cared for no other 	 48.12612039356445
her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense 	 36.08130839057193
mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter 	 139.93972745084116
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept 	 149.6304150501195
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur 	 85.38031889789205
in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief 	 34.292728586784655
he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring 	 22.716770489645683
i had not believed it possible 	 32.630455462385584
i suspected as much replied elizabeth 	 41.492567407627476
but how did he account for it 	 44.03412152433806
it must have been his sister is doing 	 83.05952751736697
they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects 	 43.14971538558235
but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other 	 47.18947282357025
that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter 	 37.005725782325555
good girl 	 64.98411383749578
it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingley is pretended regard 	 44.02388537628094
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again 	 18.549067582470443
he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty 	 99.01105604581511
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities 	 56.01187906355349
elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him 	 34.608769841200626
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed 	 48.51276827052884
cried jane 	 49.061320425304
oh 	 107.79551945762033
lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all 	 53.890808903675484
if i could but see you as happy 	 88.40458069135677
if there were but such another man for you 	 64.98411383749578
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you 	 18.36286791161701
till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness 	 64.98411383749578
no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another <title> collins in time 	 26.6048043526439
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret 	 45.14003653507598
<title> bennet was privileged to whisper it to <title> philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton 	 44.862530390313786
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune 	 25.48118967226197
chapter xiv 	 45.730520360787345
one morning about a week after bingley is engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn 	 39.856761322900944
it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours 	 46.12663055728043
the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them 	 49.02540406067085
as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery 	 42.79016886509333
they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered 	 78.07657799541138
it was lady catherine de bourgh 	 37.54568064823407
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of <title> bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt 	 33.81564106768805
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeth is salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word 	 69.3697002639556
elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship is entrance though no request of introduction had been made 	 29.700026302574464
<title> bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness 	 51.16297802507025
after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet 	 64.48598623501513
that lady i suppose is your mother 	 92.36707874094851
elizabeth replied very concisely that she was 	 77.5532835726469
and that i suppose is one of your sisters 	 44.36638719956641
yes madam said <title> bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine 	 65.13832642961127
she is my youngest girl but one 	 20.740253121268463
my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family 	 13.094705488234782
you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence 	 27.744107139139558
it is nothing in comparison of rosings my lady i dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas is 	 219.789623074025
this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west 	 154.21168915745642
<title> bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left <title> and <title> collins well 	 33.126307495988385
yes very well 	 34.50717470545049
i saw them the night before last 	 68.65864662704936
elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling 	 34.7306371283264
but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled 	 39.45577189730716
<title> bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn 	 13.811112190002692
i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company 	 64.98411383749578
go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks 	 39.85882632931694
i think she will be pleased with the hermitage 	 30.556856698026102
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs 	 45.921489027135316
as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on 	 37.4584190286798
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it 	 37.4037208495632
they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable 	 55.98701561507593
how could i ever think her like her nephew 	 52.12115813042224
said she as she looked in her face 	 190.8725500216017
as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither 	 49.79951660794745
your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come 	 92.34165413944707
elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment 	 39.68637704408271
indeed you are mistaken madam 	 29.30131802328507
i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here 	 48.703134405516145
miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with 	 31.366166972530543
but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so 	 51.44960841064593
my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it 	 75.86268741542497
a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago 	 57.32191950392601
i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew <title> darcy 	 43.72899079037544
though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you 	 35.926958572694815
if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far 	 53.56934268447016
what could your ladyship propose by it 	 56.96263433338495
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted 	 56.09280907654405
your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence 	 71.677727401359
if 	 34.22632718684832
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it 	 301.77025374091835
has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves 	 102.57717611356598
do you not know that such a report is spread abroad 	 78.71428344610683
i never heard that it was 	 44.27248254795966
and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it 	 51.86729892333845
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship 	 69.95022871738128
you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer 	 126.01840287613787
this is not to be borne 	 65.1464898663542
miss bennet i insist on being satisfied 	 54.10925832984975
has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage 	 75.90350218771584
your ladyship has declared it to be impossible 	 35.22216530693342
it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason 	 39.25650753888806
but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family 	 67.16299210565381
you may have drawn him in 	 31.337109412211706
if i have i shall be the last person to confess it 	 71.56480811755169
miss bennet do you know who i am 	 43.955960338726086
i have not been accustomed to such language as this 	 103.440789761803
i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns 	 63.307455306553216
but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit 	 35.39926818707309
let me be rightly understood 	 64.63890466635351
this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place 	 35.03771049943638
no never 	 31.979423815526523
<title> darcy is engaged to my daughter 	 53.702103767325134
now what have you to say 	 86.60525837860347
only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me 	 54.25146299199904
lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind 	 101.53920977326835
from their infancy they have been intended for each other 	 39.69788919952118
it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of her is 	 67.08893100916919
while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family 	 64.98411383749578
do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends 	 47.40428255333118
to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh 	 59.848683292266266
are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy 	 44.417880280718514
have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin 	 44.861671646420035
yes and i had heard it before 	 63.38207984937601
but what is that to me 	 84.71771621278131
if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh 	 12.832046647178723
you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage 	 75.35282651259298
its completion depended on others 	 83.29388812807414
if <title> darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice 	 56.3528414257463
and if i am that choice why may not i accept him 	 11.024271664448854
because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it 	 97.90755275362298
yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all 	 57.46421169739678
you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him 	 62.20443072665912
your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us 	 51.02552824869623
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth 	 96.25003303932012
but the wife of <title> darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine 	 7.948156001099562
obstinate headstrong girl 	 21.580559951186274
i am ashamed of you 	 51.87549934471247
is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring 	 80.48819256204143
is nothing due to me on that score 	 35.79499601961156
let us sit down 	 16.291550984230373
you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it 	 28.618353994499437
i have not been used to submit to any person is whims 	 40.105158304617895
i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment 	 61.45453154490698
that will make your ladyship is situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me 	 35.25857331968028
i will not be interrupted 	 46.38502173546242
hear me in silence 	 47.83879344617246
my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other 	 80.61388887006078
they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the father is from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families 	 42.663034225496475
their fortune on both sides is splendid 	 49.3335178569874
they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them 	 48.623196213548155
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune 	 42.63473238567007
is this to be endured 	 110.41999985794156
but it must not shall not be 	 78.12183320492144
if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up 	 105.20916580353574
in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere 	 65.81781987606767
he is a gentleman i am a gentleman is daughter so far we are equal 	 30.072887117653142
true 	 48.38312697120714
you are a gentleman is daughter 	 61.439149610105005
but who was your mother 	 28.865006383157365
who are your uncles and aunts 	 35.891485064772205
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition 	 162.96685030567218
whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you 	 59.70462284150411
tell me once for all are you engaged to him 	 61.985015798844714
though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moment is deliberation i am not 	 65.49919421787202
lady catherine seemed pleased 	 71.67946795432921
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement 	 39.92776424364473
i will make no promise of the kind 	 47.853217892253646
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished 	 103.34253605839586
i expected to find a more reasonable young woman 	 66.67449376742144
but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede 	 95.50806623939489
i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require 	 66.6644737912191
and i certainly never shall give it 	 79.72405751332577
i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable 	 31.71221195746398
your ladyship wants <title> darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable 	 29.107415882273752
supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin 	 39.192870999803944
allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged 	 67.47970411082598
you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these 	 91.94577435313646
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine 	 69.4774828277158
i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject 	 30.668175987696806
not so hasty if you please 	 66.71216249325026
i have by no means done 	 85.6206386073775
to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add 	 58.353864978045976
i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister is infamous elopement 	 46.69894338276292
i know it all that the young man is marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles 	 97.83189433521099
and is such a girl to be my nephew is sister 	 44.060785513722195
is her husband is the son of his late father is steward to be his brother 	 40.038576278938685
heaven and earth 	 54.525034073642864
of what are you thinking 	 72.69061022114983
are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted 	 51.613517652061276
you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered 	 62.40861725909535
you have insulted me in every possible method 	 58.45921736179005
i must beg to return to the house 	 47.79651678380896
and she rose as she spoke 	 44.67489272854987
lady catherine rose also and they turned back 	 40.48332988581636
her ladyship was highly incensed 	 53.95664026051652
you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew 	 63.86744708611982
unfeeling selfish girl 	 51.00624955207329
do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody 	 161.96572635418838
lady catherine i have nothing farther to say 	 37.55399371529314
you know my sentiments 	 64.494494757555
you are then resolved to have him 	 50.19528308570983
i have said no such thing 	 115.90068055900727
i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me 	 63.45781574793779
it is well 	 60.92741769418351
you refuse then to oblige me 	 74.08285476946321
you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude 	 38.119072072368134
you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world 	 41.374598422423475
neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance 	 63.376199930096156
no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with <title> darcy 	 70.49443417287809
and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment is concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn 	 30.928667068722255
and this is your real opinion 	 36.11707310677762
this is your final resolve 	 59.28736975651836
very well 	 56.24331480341158
i shall now know how to act 	 37.49803937840173
do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified 	 49.40289923923869
i came to try you 	 33.916964288287396
i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point 	 74.32423347379422
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet 	 92.86843950905019
i send no compliments to your mother 	 82.94161041753706
you deserve no such attention 	 51.985732680145226
i am most seriously displeased 	 63.11700009909672
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself 	 66.70686578945946
she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs 	 140.18099008675622
her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself 	 117.58954310582574
she did not choose it said her daughter she would go 	 15.144159609931057
she is a very fine looking woman 	 35.14366905963769
and her calling here was prodigiously civil 	 58.83630813048682
for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well 	 69.23220500174135
she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you 	 55.58027115793703
i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy 	 88.84278170820846
elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible 	 113.19649676198655
chapter xv 	 44.76680855695274
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly 	 8.123526127823142
lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with <title> darcy 	 27.856579968877973
it was a rational scheme to be sure 	 17.9182022337372
but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea 	 47.982435158666405
she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together 	 46.977013600924856
and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time 	 13.500562443851518
in revolving lady catherine is expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference 	 62.66189812586606
from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce 	 59.79277115514112
she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side 	 50.7068378676388
with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning 	 43.52396850016153
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him 	 59.76866206800129
in that case he would return no more 	 53.25796911254101
lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way 	 47.50213840058476
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it 	 100.63765007805269
i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy 	 52.3440195196229
if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all 	 32.59426770757877
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased <title> bennet is curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject 	 72.24930558696356
the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand 	 38.597836769501875
lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room 	 36.311610646077256
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held 	 19.960139671877258
it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations 	 60.27789406852533
she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down 	 30.448503422251584
he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly 	 69.1050257139199
as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents 	 37.12606651895054
i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony 	 62.80952647817498
let me congratulate you on a very important conquest 	 43.65963833250217
the colour now rushed into elizabeth is cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious 	 45.086763653643104
young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer 	 52.00718166856423
this letter is from <title> collins 	 61.92393354702699
from <title> collins 	 49.08126433833729
and what can he have to say 	 10.840152145120612
something very much to the purpose of course 	 36.28623903885296
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping lucases 	 44.33315841633911
i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point 	 187.55185890088865
what relates to yourself is as follows 	 44.029035145075476
having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of <title> collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority 	 89.37588977263934
your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land 	 89.02451999412327
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this 	 74.67394381161053
this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage 	 67.32207165554392
yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman is proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of 	 67.76091096691842
have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is 	 31.203989533171487
but now it comes out 	 53.12612427797959
my motive for cautioning you is as follows 	 26.931137220694488
we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye 	 45.391902674641585
<title> darcy you see is the man 	 60.33253297572569
now lizzy i think i have surprised you 	 78.59131973361289
could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related 	 60.53814671485038
<title> darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life 	 41.10344400922251
it is admirable 	 90.14593258049563
elizabeth tried to join in her father is pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile 	 73.7546133196861
never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her 	 89.62883179551696
are you not diverted 	 53.340822321486215
oh 	 51.69117612132664
yes 	 32.055133882139344
pray read on 	 40.277050115534905
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match 	 25.756328296491834
i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned 	 29.11021913667148
<title> collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia is sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known 	 50.420917514648735
i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married 	 61.18184260385246
it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it 	 50.795942250615454
you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing 	 90.55269975886462
that is his notion of christian forgiveness 	 30.050808728700254
the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte is situation and his expectation of a young olive branch 	 51.45492896335151
but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it 	 80.32867104242412
you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report 	 187.11611861390918
for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn 	 40.60405583578086
oh 	 67.88429589494703
cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted 	 49.92996190762673
but it is so strange 	 27.503928836134623
yes that is what makes it amusing 	 88.54461861689154
had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd 	 51.37586469141732
much as i abominate writing i would not give up <title> collins is correspondence for any consideration 	 47.827477064521666
nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law 	 38.326585892030316
and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report 	 24.5960598993752
did she call to refuse her consent 	 205.67690882885861
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it 	 7.910836431903329
elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not 	 11.866316748113356
it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried 	 40.50181542338366
her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of <title> darcy is indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much 	 41.21229608446069
chapter xvi 	 18.991322117908293
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected <title> bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine is visit 	 7.948156001099562
the gentlemen arrived early and before <title> bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out 	 62.67471660259111
it was agreed to 	 28.751144861667353
<title> bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together 	 64.98411383749578
bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them 	 38.469321769661214
they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other 	 52.427236187125835
very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same 	 30.87268765662895
they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone 	 50.109067255986865
now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said <title> darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding your is 	 55.58590751975195
i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister 	 43.48188597100551
ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it 	 58.11591473110179
were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express 	 36.757016132353264
i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness 	 77.28880629306343
i did not think <title> gardiner was so little to be trusted 	 43.15947626534126
you must not blame my aunt 	 97.07803456451413
lydia is thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars 	 67.36322059936701
let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them 	 40.35116194970274
if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone 	 19.65552343586138
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny 	 97.65946134663184
but your family owe me nothing 	 56.695715438096435
much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you 	 50.13493172045104
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word 	 31.71779586490296
after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me 	 32.35518824976514
if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once 	 64.98411383749578
my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever 	 37.30172363077459
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances 	 34.0916492013527
the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do 	 59.461026650868384
had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable 	 40.12612779222108
they walked on without knowing in what direction 	 36.36872703350411
there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects 	 99.00492688000703
she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyship is apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give 	 65.22081232844883
but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise 	 42.86404832594447
it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before 	 40.20689723346616
i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly 	 33.339302685721435
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that 	 84.40277756210683
after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations 	 21.217004814862737
what did you say of me that i did not deserve 	 15.275310823604702
for though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof 	 117.6536983492688
it was unpardonable 	 25.233717764286542
i cannot think of it without abhorrence 	 73.48830355360981
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth 	 86.9372013046876
the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility 	 45.11697501648389
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself 	 63.28919436534748
the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me 	 53.20470720136154
your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner 	 54.207390035282344
those were your words 	 48.07875983428047
you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice 	 50.446997953874735
i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression 	 31.878821546115564
i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way 	 52.97287021271146
i can easily believe it 	 91.73817730175
you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did 	 43.42167818520328
the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me 	 40.114033992715655
oh 	 61.6428023044731
do not repeat what i then said 	 72.36090638855295
these recollections will not do at all 	 43.11150676917192
i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it 	 51.350979976099815
darcy mentioned his letter 	 56.37925567053433
did it said he did it soon make you think better of me 	 78.51658578108264
did you on reading it give any credit to its contents 	 69.56257216291246
she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed 	 112.75073734091039
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary 	 49.44808194967704
i hope you have destroyed the letter 	 49.607535448603805
there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again 	 40.289846124320064
i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me 	 66.32332513561433
the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies 	 74.6682742170966
when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit 	 35.30458952085559
the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so 	 102.29564753390687
the adieu is charity itself 	 53.64925619787096
but think no more of the letter 	 46.403353086300584
the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten 	 58.80078817387729
you must learn some of my philosophy 	 54.388785531918586
think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure 	 25.246739799770022
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind 	 61.382103450617166
your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance 	 57.06074312747238
but with me it is not so 	 57.89511336069219
painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled 	 176.43351477453717
i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle 	 93.35779292929551
as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper 	 42.35702908411961
i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit 	 42.15882824811018
unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own 	 39.64033344423959
such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth 	 35.49925051032197
what do i not owe you 	 102.82635920488165
you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous 	 66.5330773497901
by you i was properly humbled 	 51.248751468444524
i came to you without a doubt of my reception 	 261.4117642700471
you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased 	 19.017571174336382
had you then persuaded yourself that i should 	 11.828817268080241
indeed i had 	 93.7361282261459
what will you think of my vanity 	 22.983944240139145
i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses 	 144.74320867687035
my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you 	 47.316777954568245
i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong 	 47.19990635784737
how you must have hated me after that evening 	 29.16479976796023
hate you 	 85.9149962645892
i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction 	 53.780876562331706
i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley 	 36.47678904502981
you blamed me for coming 	 32.30342389296882
no indeed i felt nothing but surprise 	 54.85912075322128
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you 	 75.56353470442103
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due 	 31.389907747249854
my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to 	 82.61186974790236
how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you 	 48.082867823981104
he then told her of georgiana is delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend 	 115.47450778460988
she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther 	 111.03789754007403
after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home 	 53.02847758751022
what could become of <title> bingley and jane 	 33.126569968482656
was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs 	 48.21855022042704
darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it 	 29.60837516176279
i must ask whether you were surprised 	 25.297337216132643
said elizabeth 	 37.708650520123776
not at all 	 78.04885729672331
when i went away i felt that it would soon happen 	 34.809815099770425
that is to say you had given your permission 	 47.86554632536794
i guessed as much 	 94.1263292720868
and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case 	 63.05544485549749
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago 	 37.86265408286719
i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent 	 28.891718950863318
his surprise was great 	 49.59306310687706
he had never had the slightest suspicion 	 26.434487588089706
i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together 	 49.565624353928314
elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend 	 49.90181147999395
did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring 	 9.969415167895201
from the former 	 61.43348198341977
i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection 	 48.38325237272648
and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him 	 18.48146276602657
it did 	 54.186326062753864
bingley is most unaffectedly modest 	 73.65732755837799
his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy 	 78.94146274306651
i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him 	 18.681829111205758
i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him 	 78.99825232084719
he was angry 	 43.83591114784759
but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister is sentiments 	 61.68241688582951
he has heartily forgiven me now 	 29.45503703219056
elizabeth longed to observe that <title> bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself 	 17.578847940713192
she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin 	 91.06008724010262
in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house 	 30.083506097371252
in the hall they parted 	 50.75971573242842
chapter xvii 	 110.60266454097507
my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to 	 73.34261487401409
was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table 	 26.71010101634694
she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge 	 43.16917392855067
she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth 	 101.52773643099059
the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary 	 24.398826742416425
the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent 	 45.54524091531576
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her 	 20.66804775154171
she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away 	 45.29721532470541
at night she opened her heart to jane 	 106.41053658192284
though suspicion was very far from miss bennet is general habits she was absolutely incredulous here 	 49.62001185401012
you are joking lizzy 	 46.24485062213063
this cannot be 	 52.91778814090886
engaged to <title> darcy 	 18.4091663361798
no no you shall not deceive me 	 57.94175374411125
i know it to be impossible 	 29.775178398116154
this is a wretched beginning indeed 	 64.98411383749578
my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not 	 73.6066607830609
yet indeed i am in earnest 	 80.4657487139201
i speak nothing but the truth 	 83.79802293083573
he still loves me and we are engaged 	 99.2878278146182
jane looked at her doubtingly 	 122.52258200611507
oh lizzy 	 54.670578056330115
it cannot be 	 14.939628025935345
i know how much you dislike him 	 68.99155547859982
you know nothing of the matter 	 77.42254074060084
that is all to be forgot 	 57.11003573497551
perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now 	 42.23257997012513
but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable 	 37.602862452642256
this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself 	 62.225806683291005
miss bennet still looked all amazement 	 17.981836343479948
elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth 	 42.55459085721757
good heaven 	 32.68078457348169
can it be really so 	 77.53108780272997
yet now i must believe you cried jane 	 42.823091018122454
my dear dear lizzy i would i do congratulate you but are you certain 	 58.4892575896121
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him 	 74.29172573402397
there can be no doubt of that 	 34.21547094992873
it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world 	 42.667031440894384
but are you pleased jane 	 51.023722810758855
shall you like to have such a brother 	 103.81963416929355
very very much 	 62.63103308785348
nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight 	 55.70121287785233
but we considered it we talked of it as impossible 	 79.11447204454231
and do you really love him quite well enough 	 100.49769428740923
oh lizzy 	 77.8155514765593
do any thing rather than marry without affection 	 92.52129362786366
are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do 	 37.89582854031494
oh yes 	 55.909465924196674
you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all 	 33.519235632477034
what do you mean 	 119.75107012501556
why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley 	 9.328865848510599
i am afraid you will be angry 	 19.913662741566405
my dearest sister now be be serious 	 24.95996759579901
i want to talk very seriously 	 81.85811250086826
let me know every thing that i am to know without delay 	 10.82390883109475
will you tell me how long you have loved him 	 38.868454170918596
it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began 	 49.21816486654917
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley 	 95.85992508365439
another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment 	 26.99838449743429
when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish 	 30.690696747372385
now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself 	 50.79106044724478
i always had a value for him 	 77.91082708756078
were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingley is friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me 	 26.861019939172422
but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me 	 52.13033858010652
how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton 	 22.55653741047632
i owe all that i know of it to another not to you 	 64.98411383749578
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy 	 55.42871259115267
she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend 	 54.99739034444191
but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydia is marriage 	 32.59068273903704
all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation 	 50.54490965634962
good gracious 	 62.2253795852326
cried <title> bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable <title> darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley 	 40.76771190427331
what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here 	 32.92965023303112
i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company 	 53.04187981376255
what shall we do with him 	 43.16601711052717
lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingley is way 	 102.74059911507892
elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet 	 57.32961724892995
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud <title> bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day 	 69.5217996214095
i advise <title> darcy and lizzy and kitty said <title> bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning 	 53.05766767388572
it is a nice long walk and <title> darcy has never seen the view 	 46.626907098808296
it may do very well for the others replied <title> bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty 	 62.715025788750005
wont it kitty 	 60.59841564812928
kitty owned that she had rather stay at home 	 65.4237723107575
darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented 	 63.221274686092315
as she went up stairs to get ready <title> bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself 	 24.83433291032785
but i hope you will not mind it it is all for jane is sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then 	 61.49260845451306
so do not put yourself to inconvenience 	 52.217304797891245
during their walk it was resolved that <title> bennet is consent should be asked in the course of the evening 	 65.58881923023941
elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother is 	 28.67437909630193
she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man 	 20.53427990825489
but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that <title> darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation 	 37.94521037400122
in the evening soon after <title> bennet withdrew to the library she saw <title> darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme 	 65.83390362083651
she did not fear her father is opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till <title> darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile 	 132.38868610864185
in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library 	 90.99326623140668
she was gone directly 	 74.87806967596218
her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious 	 53.13622025295166
lizzy said he what are you doing 	 60.66551194917896
are you out of your senses to be accepting this man 	 57.04716234145172
have not you always hated him 	 29.111052320878542
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate 	 59.66824879470972
it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to <title> darcy 	 21.085602537814843
or in other words you are determined to have him 	 97.4570133642354
he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane 	 51.88521919776376
but will they make you happy 	 60.25096627494658
have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference 	 29.195708602536303
none at all 	 130.10855005737858
we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him 	 32.569657244110886
i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him 	 36.3411598786756
indeed he has no improper pride 	 54.73641405097804
he is perfectly amiable 	 32.655657998636656
you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms 	 64.98411383749578
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent 	 62.770844917710875
he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask 	 96.6647135218745
i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him 	 51.857051321966274
but let me advise you to think better of it 	 36.05062082487126
i know your disposition lizzy 	 17.40652378199222
i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior 	 54.3832993526534
your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage 	 13.409575631562793
you could scarcely escape discredit and misery 	 45.13478558017486
my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life 	 58.85332852826665
you know not what you are about 	 86.08797604692816
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that <title> darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father is incredulity and reconcile him to the match 	 51.73860679456834
well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say 	 81.11025857747863
if this be the case he deserves you 	 22.80667095723298
i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy 	 46.494389685197454
to complete the favourable impression she then told him what <title> darcy had voluntarily done for lydia 	 46.08903131758823
he heard her with astonishment 	 47.64369191785691
this is an evening of wonders indeed 	 64.31866946533437
and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellow is debts and got him his commission 	 51.86165042243564
so much the better 	 70.91511192467961
it will save me a world of trouble and economy 	 62.534827684678504
had it been your uncle is doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way 	 36.820275696389956
i shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter 	 40.916649917837404
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading <title> collins is letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure 	 69.57021442862656
elizabeth is mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour is quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure 	 55.45100154861693
every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time 	 29.669718778468322
when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication 	 69.08525893880694
its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it <title> bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable 	 88.81111142980461
nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them 	 31.970906810966106
she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself 	 73.86073518256389
good gracious 	 64.98411383749578
lord bless me 	 52.89207218769203
only think 	 78.20085437453922
dear me 	 23.96269422670167
<title> darcy 	 33.598374633185905
who would have thought it 	 31.351344319151007
and is it really true 	 87.4246361822968
oh 	 34.36745374108358
my sweetest lizzy 	 41.42568382227667
how rich and how great you will be 	 41.09714145520805
what pin money what jewels what carriages you will have 	 31.818264962843525
jane is is nothing to it nothing at all 	 62.937347331421655
i am so pleased so happy 	 45.958833112946934
such a charming man 	 32.24448299089179
so handsome 	 11.810113398530527
so tall 	 99.51492960362604
oh my dear lizzy 	 25.252791448153364
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before 	 101.54973973801928
i hope he will overlook it 	 34.25113438633489
dear dear lizzy 	 60.00109328255479
a house in town 	 34.66847340695587
every thing that is charming 	 93.28692458888479
three daughters married 	 25.83796007272614
ten thousand a year 	 55.08211813486866
oh lord 	 16.23345077187691
what will become of me 	 24.988309806299114
i shall go distracted 	 43.40689888902879
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away 	 27.225228034781555
but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her 	 43.52738411902516
my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else 	 22.169296077140707
ten thousand a year and very likely more 	 43.20035621507189
tis as good as a lord 	 45.91978194035684
and a special licence 	 44.69082631952152
you must and shall be married by a special licence 	 64.98411383749578
but my dearest love tell me what dish <title> darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow 	 36.73528990567899
this was a sad omen of what her mother is behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for 	 14.201689633990224
but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for <title> bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion 	 86.43618841291656
elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and <title> bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem 	 96.18835827245431
i admire all my three sons in law highly said he 	 86.51815506554382
wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as jane is 	 47.266587342948355
chapter xviii 	 57.86703320075071
elizabeth is spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted <title> darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her 	 22.50091671466199
how could you begin 	 48.81078163266966
said she 	 64.98411383749578
i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place 	 23.726003410749605
i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation 	 56.16469787050171
it is too long ago 	 73.78752835811429
i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun 	 68.29044881229498
my beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not 	 59.28980882463176
now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence 	 149.5912074676298
for the liveliness of your mind i did 	 401.6671447511373
you may as well call it impertinence at once 	 124.08487539697433
it was very little less 	 34.32881362344298
the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention 	 55.31257565004568
you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone 	 106.66649038051503
i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them 	 53.255946702503
had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you 	 61.97344597971175
there i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable 	 19.14278006630848
to be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love 	 87.06170185255007
was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield 	 43.108959136756226
dearest jane 	 66.1770299533079
who could have done less for her 	 59.107801557003945
but make a virtue of it by all means 	 49.73727410669456
my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last 	 38.845986272380536
what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here 	 77.28419290231328
why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me 	 59.995610997903576
because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement 	 86.86555424699104
but i was embarrassed 	 75.75564822108768
and so was i 	 99.0561322759907
you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner 	 49.851235503169256
a man who had felt less might 	 113.95517040708714
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it 	 33.81749938140206
but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself 	 79.05718030386768
i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you 	 103.68680408117208
my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect 	 60.32408597119767
_too much_ i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject 	 74.6541418198758
this will never do 	 65.2430520065689
you need not distress yourself 	 80.90465118508823
the moral will be perfectly fair 	 44.598435144022645
lady catherine is unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts 	 65.67194510900688
i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude 	 59.78430277562496
i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your is 	 128.8242767846257
my aunt is intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing 	 14.788122003793381
lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use 	 42.40690562304323
but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for 	 42.76143931413822
was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed 	 58.703446940844344
or had you intended any more serious consequence 	 49.64194464243339
my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me 	 37.624233089271435
my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made 	 65.82662733262482
shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her 	 49.42181904862662
i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth 	 48.24082014448293
but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly 	 82.36174923986546
and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did 	 37.22809943867187
but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected 	 41.73678702203054
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with <title> darcy had been over rated elizabeth had never yet answered <title> gardiner is long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write 	 58.213266039942674
you supposed more than really existed 	 46.16521534827909
but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err 	 69.16830852410806
you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last 	 64.98411383749578
i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes 	 61.22095333573645
how could i be so silly as to wish it 	 45.78272392668976
your idea of the ponies is delightful 	 33.83680167986134
we will go round the park every day 	 26.28623406941587
i am the happiest creature in the world 	 42.4005627312941
perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice 	 52.15851115799021
i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh 	 78.24169535980928
<title> darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me 	 86.30176571514697
you are all to come to pemberley at christmas 	 48.71146566967264
your is c 	 90.75141273623467
<title> darcy is letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what <title> bennet sent to <title> collins in reply to his last 	 214.80324202347703
dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations 	 64.98411383749578
elizabeth will soon be the wife of <title> darcy 	 20.121964531611937
console lady catherine as well as you can 	 93.04961552150226
but if i were you i would stand by the nephew 	 240.9393645342002
he has more to give 	 51.68212235053133
your is sincerely c 	 70.93300549419303
miss bingley is congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere 	 50.99526792093404
she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard 	 42.512843605145626
jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved 	 36.16417144832423
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother is in sending it 	 129.79763502500657
four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister 	 59.13703617855646
before any answer could arrive from <title> collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge 	 163.06502265046112
the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident 	 64.98724874843984
lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew is letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over 	 23.68883172977767
at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw <title> darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband 	 51.45036962892019
he bore it however with admirable calmness 	 58.82443079503958
he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st 	 19.493479131325167
james is with very decent composure 	 28.11523439591329
if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight 	 54.401849792328726
<title> philips is vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though <title> philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley is good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar 	 63.52542067678045
nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant 	 41.80959860769044
elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley 	 48.05302527622986
chapter xix 	 47.667703345896975
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which <title> bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters 	 118.54265977653591
with what delighted pride she afterwards visited <title> bingley and talked of <title> darcy may be guessed 	 42.680081364501355
i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly 	 40.25162078717084
<title> bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do 	 54.961784034231975
he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected 	 33.688697447152684
<title> bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth 	 44.8757971614655
so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart 	 40.22129394162029
the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other 	 81.02913263712085
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters 	 56.91360650299758
in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great 	 73.02137115440478
she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydia is example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid 	 28.69435195423944
from the farther disadvantage of lydia is society she was of course carefully kept and though <title> wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going 	 38.78932285706703
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by <title> bennet is being quite unable to sit alone 	 64.50392171976885
mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance 	 50.49705717217612
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters 	 62.59777724683169
he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune 	 53.798660943695786
the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished 	 222.52336419512244
the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy 	 96.12189281125394
if you love <title> darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy 	 25.98756930366447
it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us 	 78.22698154657414
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help 	 71.31376739448646
any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to <title> darcy about it if you had rather not 	 55.658834618417956
yours c 	 75.29498716334172
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind 	 43.09406428104934
such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them 	 63.84275523868438
it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills 	 48.37077507922118
their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme 	 29.948285914278134
they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought 	 63.336319304170736
his affection for her soon sunk into indifference her is lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her 	 54.81461684373745
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeth is sake he assisted him farther in his profession 	 32.22118101203727
lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingley is good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone 	 49.98359911760897
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy is marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth 	 47.182332385039814
pemberley was now georgiana is home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see 	 47.944882091330676
they were able to love each other even as well as they intended 	 83.55531634668343
georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother 	 23.761362831962604
he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry 	 45.058489772317344
her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way 	 58.38634770340909
by elizabeth is instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself 	 45.65625020517769
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end 	 23.268888259947484
but at length by elizabeth is persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city 	 68.43080390536517
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms 	 64.98411383749578
darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them. 	 50.67992911721199
