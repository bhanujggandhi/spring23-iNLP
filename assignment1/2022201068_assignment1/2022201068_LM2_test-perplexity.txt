<s> though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness. <e>	57.767796510273115
<s> of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. <e>	38.3903358075244

<s> if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes. <e>	79.75123134491253
<s> the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion is justifying her coming so far alone. <e>	85.4825513883967

<s> when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so. <e>	92.12494082785486
<s> his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. <e>	84.74705116793108

<s> in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well. <e>	25.764957367223875

<s> i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished. <e>	42.198241053227115
<s> i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished. <e>	49.11505977832232
<s> all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading. <e>	57.60599858683432
<s> bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable. <e>	45.50645388772979
<s> they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister. <e>	167.1586708497107
<s> elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister is room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from <title> bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. <e>	51.683721338235685
<s> in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation. <e>	93.6232315917388
<s> indeed i have sir was her answer. <e>	26.093488077899895
<s> <title> bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. <e>	9.278975025984705
<s> i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with. <e>	41.84522650442124
<s> lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home. <e>	73.27129295514922

<s> they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either. <e>	70.23022643742547

<s> nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance. <e>	43.67351548306613
<s> his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards <title> darcy with a very expressive smile. <e>	75.04566876823056
<s> not that i think charlotte so very plain but then she is our particular friend. <e>	51.71921190827225
<s> and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently. <e>	55.52729201032246
<s> i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy. <e>	41.84148257989377
<s> every thing nourishes what is strong already. <e>	41.82543373263636
<s> but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away. <e>	52.96335622777463
<s> darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. <e>	152.57184002235073
<s> she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle is good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance. <e>	103.68469369915597
<s> i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not. <e>	43.842267854714585
<s> <title> hurst and <title> bingley were at piquet and <title> hurst was observing their game. <e>	40.38690791794428
<s> the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each. <e>	118.75010513108714
<s> he made no answer. <e>	3.7109080690297582

<s> i shall see her in january. <e>	9.068250652702774
<s> he leaves out half his words and blots the rest. <e>	75.74517402106426
<s> your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month. <e>	165.0716335346894
<s> we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. <e>	98.34323413670052
<s> but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it. <e>	103.9314227130847
<s> perhaps i do. <e>	8.26192077186741
<s> they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit. <e>	153.71854873167385

<s> darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and <title> hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brother is conversation with miss bennet. <e>	72.09789735457949
<s> how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book. when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library. <e>	50.2735204853734
<s> if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards. <e>	140.04917469409008
<s> it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day. <e>	76.8511399931649
<s> her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious. <e>	60.11612383471234

<s> <title> bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again. but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle. <e>	85.37727112926582
